In 2017, the Louis Vuitton x Supreme collaboration not only rocketed Supreme\u2019s popularity in China, but also opened a new door to younger Chinese consumers for Louis Vuitton. Given this success, it\u2019s no wonder that more and more top-tier luxury brands are venturing into streetwear culture and the social buzz around it. Dior, however, missed an opportunity with their St\u00fcssy collaboration by not fully promoting it prior to its debut. For example, Dior\u2019s official Instagram video posts only highlighted the design approach without verbally mentioning who the collaboration was with, while on Chinese social media, Dior used only one Weibo post with the same vaguely cryptic video campaign showing only St\u00fcssy\u2019s iconic style without any verbal messaging. Moreover, the video was overshadowed by Dior\u2019s other posts featuring the Chinese singer/actor, Karry Wang, in Miami for the upcoming show. Two weeks ago, Wang was appointed as the new brand ambassador for Dior Men.", "Implications:\u00a0", "The luxury brands that have ventured into the luxury-streetwear collaboration approach as a way to gain access to younger consumers\u2019 attention have, in fact, under-communicated the messaging behind these collaborations, especially when it comes to China. Both Chinese millennials and Gen Zers have fervently pursued these types of collaborations, particularly when top-tier players are behind them. Take the Louis Vuitton x Supreme collaboration, which sold out in three days in Beijing, rather than the originally projected two weeks. Clearly the consumer demand is there, though relying on streetwear related social media rather than the luxury brand\u2019s official account is limiting the collaboration\u2019s intent to a very self-selected group of consumers and missing the wider range of luxury consumers that are looking for the next cool thing. Collaborations like the Dior x St\u00fcssy are not very common, though at the beginning of the Dior Men\u2019s Pre-Fall 2020 show, Dior announced yet another collaboration between the brand, but this time with \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Air Jordan!

As attendees wandered around the Grand Hall of the Shanghai Exhibition Center, trees dripping with fairy lights, drinks in hand, that an oddly familiar and seemingly out of place tune filled the room \u2014 the classic Chinese patriotic song, \u201cMy Motherland and Me.\u201d (\u201c\u6211\u548c\u6211\u7684\u7956\u56fd\u201d).", "The attendees found the choice of \u201cMy Motherland and Me\u201d an amusing addition to the night\u2019s events, from a classic runway show to an unambiguous demonstration of the brand\u2019s support of Chinese nationalism. This comes at a timely moment, following the brand\u2019s recent misstep at a college workshop, which involved a map of China that omitted Taiwan.", "Immediately after the event, videos of the \u201cMy Motherland and Me\u201d at the after-party went viral on Chinese social media, generating polarized reactions from netizens. While Dior did not explicitly say why this song was played, many in the Chinese community took it to be an extension of their recent apology.", "Some netizen thought the song choice was forced, stating that it was a simply a gimmick to appease Chinese consumers.

More forgiving netizens, meanwhile, took Dior\u2019s act as an example of a foreign brand \u201ctrying too hard\u201d to survive in China. Another Chinese netizen (\u8521\u601d\u6167GD) commented below the video, \u201cDior\u2019s desire to survive [in China] is full of the screen\u201d (\u201c\u6ee1\u6ee1\u7684\u6c42\u751f\u6b32\u201d). Nevertheless, many acknowledged Dior\u2019s efforts to save itself from a catastrophe among Chinese consumers, as another netizen (\u5de5\u85e4\u7531\u5e0c\u5b50) commented, \u201cEven though the song does not make sense in the atmosphere at least Dior is sincere.\u201d (\u201c\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u6b4c\u653e\u8fd9\u4e0d\u592a\u642d \u4f46\u662f\u633a\u8bda\u6073\u7684\u201d).", "Given this, what did Dior do right?

The prompt official response to the public played an important role in preventing the backlash from spreading more widely. However, a large population of netizens deemed the apology insincere and regarded it as a standard reaction, as they believed Dior has learned from previous brands\u2019 missteps to come up with a prompt official response to combat the clashes among netizens. One netizen (HVanish) commented, \u201cWe do not accept this type of meaningless crisis PR\u201d (\u201d\u4e0d\u63a5\u53d7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5371\u673a\u516c\u5173\u201d) under Dior\u2019s initial statement on Weibo.", "In addition, some Chinese netizens believed an apology limited within only Chinese social media is not enough to communicate the brand\u2019s heartfelt regret in its wrongdoing but rather a pretentious show only for the Chinese. The most-liked comment from LUMIQUE, which received over 60 thousands likes, under Dior\u2019s statement on Weibo saying, \u201cWarning: previous fallen-out brands who only posted on Weibo but not Instagram all went through a very bad time in China\u201d (\u201c\u63d0\u9192\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ea\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4e0d\u53d1ins\u7684\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u597d\u4e0b\u573a\u201d).", "Unlike previous luxury brand missteps, where brand ambassadors were decidedly quick to sever relationships with the brand, Dior managed to maintain its relationship with influencers and celebrities. No major Dior ambassadors publicly denounced or boycotted the brand, nor did they abandon the scheduled runway show in Shanghai. Nevertheless, the collective silence from ambassadors and influencers comes at a price too. Netizens blame Dior\u2019s ambassadors for tolerating a brand that does not respect China and abandoning their integrity for money. One netizen ( TJ\u96c4) commented, \u201cNone of Dior\u2019s brand ambassador raised their voice regarding this misstep,\u201d and received over 200 likes. This helped Dior as the controversy pointed more toward the ambassadors than the brand.", "The timing of Dior\u2019s map mistake on October 16th was unfortunate for Dior, given its proximity to the brand\u2019s runway show in Shanghai. A tight window for the two events gave the brand a limited time frame to decide how to move forward. And yet, Dior seemingly turned the runway show into an opportunity to further exhibit its attitude on the previous wrongdoing beyond the initial standardized statement. Even though playing Chinese patriotic song looks clumsy and out-of-context for an iconic French brand, and was taken largely as a joke by netizens and influencers who were at the show, Dior\u2019s desire to survive in China and its fear of losing the lucrative Chinese market was well-received among Chinese consumers.\u00a0Such an exaggerated choice of action, however, was much better received than undercompensating, as overreacting demonstrated Dior\u2019s resolution and fear, which soothed the outrage of some Chinese consumers. One netizen (\u4e09\u6761\u5e26\u9c7c) commented, \u201cIt is dumb but it is working.\u201d (\u201c\u6709\u70b9\u8822\u4f46\u6709\u7528\u201d).

Given the two day window between the scandal and the show, the looks had clearly been designed long before the incident. Added to this, the brand\u2019s larger decision to frequently bring fashion shows to Shanghai. Moreover, Dior received the highest Jing Daily Fashion Week Score among brands in Paris, through engaging social content, well-balanced choice of celebrity ambassadors, and localized communication channels such as Tencent\u2019s live-streaming platform.", "In the end, it would greatly benefit Western luxury brands to understand the Chinese market and its consumers much better, remembering that prevention is the best cure for a crisis. Even though a large part of the netizens that roasted Dior on Chinese social media may never actually buy a Dior product, it\u2019s important for Dior, and other Western luxury brands, to be aware of the culture among Chinese online community, and the importance of maintaining a long-standing, loyal, and authentic image in the eyes of Chinese consumers.

Not addressing the issue on global channels is viewed as disingenuous. Chinese consumers expect a sincere apology to be replicated everywhere as a sign of respect to the global Chinese community.\u201d", "Various Western brands have suffered from major losses in sales in China after making cultural or political errors. Noticeably, Dolce and Gabbana has seen its sales almost entirely wiped out in its largest market after its costly mistake involving a promotional video showing a Chinese model clumsily trying to eat pizza with chopsticks, along with a delayed, half-hearted apology to fans. Despite other brands suffering significant losses in sales due to political faux pas, those who apologize immediately tend to be offered a second chance by Chinese consumers.", "Versace has also come under fire in recent weeks, after identifying Hong Kong as a separate country to China on a t-shirt. However, perhaps learning from the Dolce & Gabbana controversy last year, Versace reacted quickly, issuing an apology on Weibo roughly 12 minutes after the story broke. Nonetheless, netizens still complained about the absence of apologies on Western social media. Shortly after, the brand\u2019s founder, Donatella Versace, also issued an apology on Versace\u2019s various social media accounts including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.", "So why do these faux pas keep occurring? According to Di Lieto, the answer is simple. \u201cCompanies to various degrees are still thinking with a Western mindset and expecting whatever works in other countries to be more or less suitable in China. If senior executives and anyone within companies involved in communication, design, and distribution in China cannot adopt a Chinese mindset, then they need to appointment those that can reliably oversee those processes. Without it, mistakes will happen, and they will be costly. This Dior incident highlights the real danger of not localizing assets. It is also important to get communications content right by having an intimate knowledge of the psychology of the audience.

There are different types made-to-order for customers: one is the customization \u201cunder the brand,\u201d which aligns with the public perception of made-to-order luxury. The second type is \u201cabove the brand,\u201d meaning that the customers still want something specific from the brand that\u2019s outside its current offerings. The highest level is free customization, for example, when someone \u201cmay want the Herm\u00e8s to design an outfit with Zegna\u2019s materials,\u201d Dr. Zhou says.\u00a0", "What used to be an additional service for luxury brands has grown with the Chinese market. Some brands\u2019 made-to-order services have become a driving force for their China area\u2019s double-digit growth. For others, made-to-order accounts for as much as 70% of the companies\u2019 sales, according to Yaok\u2019s research.\u00a0", "Along with made-to-order expansion in China, issues have surfaced. \u201cChinese people have different body types compared to Europeans, so when European luxury brands use their sampling for Chinese customers, it doesn\u2019t fit,\u201d Dr. Zhou says, adding that one loyal Herm\u00e8s customer told Yaok Institute that he once had to look at other brands\u2019 gloves instead of a pair from Herm\u00e8s because they didn\u2019t fit perfectly. Although she already started seeing brands tackling the issue with infrared technology, it hasn\u2019t been widely adopted.\u00a0", "The industry\u2019s inclination for a sense of rarity may also be a potential problem. While brands like Chanel and Celine reportedly need six months or longer to ship a bespoke order, some newcomers in the West, like the leatherwear producer 1Atelier have built their business model on made-to-order, promising to deliver their customized bags (cost between $300 and $8,000) in three weeks. Ermenegildo Zegna is also promising a similar delivery time for their made-to-measure suits and shirts in China, according to its website, but it would still take most other brands more than three months.\u00a0", "Zegna promises a 21-day delivery time for their made-to-measure offerings in China, according to its website, but it would take most other brands much longer.

This online disruption of the luxury market is shaping how millions of Chinese consumers shop daily. In fact, all brands and retailers have embraced digital channels to some extent in order to counteract losses in the offline retail section and capitalize on this growing sector which is willing to spend.\u00a0", "Over the past month, global luxury brands have attempted to get on board with the fast-moving digitalization trend in China too. Prada has officially launched a Tmall flagship store and Belgiain leather luxury house Delvaux landed on JD.com this month. Runway shows went virtual at Milan and Paris fashion weeks as a range of digital campaigns debuted to maintain connections with Chinese consumers, like Fenty Beauty\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day campaign. This successful venture featured three loveletters from their Greater China Brand Ambassador, Fan Chengcheng as well as the spokesperson Wang Ju, and the fashion influencer, Mia Kong.\u00a0", "As expected, most of the international brand attempts, however, have shown less flexibility than local players and struggled to drive online traffic and sales. Without the presence of celebrities and KOLs, these campaigns and events failed to engage Chinese netizens in the public domain unlike domestic attempts on Weibo.\u00a0", "By contrast, many experienced homegrown brands have easily adapted to unexpected situations like the COVID-19 crisis thanks to solid customer relationships built through the new phenomenon of social selling. These initiatives, including posts in group chats and WeChat moments, alongside live-streams are being used to target consumers as they go about their lives. They are connecting with consumers by any means possible and are emerging as dynamic new marketplaces in themselves.\u00a0", "Social selling \u2014 the act of building up social relationships to nurture sales \u2014 is built upon a series of tactics rooted in \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cprivate domain\u201d traffic. Private traffic involves the direct communication between content providers and consumers (or users) thereby minimizing the dependency on third parties such as social platforms and e-commerce sites.\u00a0", "\u201cThe closest term used outside China is owned-traffic, like email lists and website traffic,\u201d explains Matthew Brennan, Co-Founder and Managing Director of WeChat marketing consultancy, China Channel. This makes sense given that Chinese netizens are not used to communicating by emails and open web is less important in China. WeChat is one of the most fundamental channels where brands typically build up private traffic.\u00a0", "Unlike public traffic which is owned by third-party platforms, private traffic exists exclusively between users and merchants, or brands. These small-size online merchants are on a tight marketing budget; interestingly, the idea is as yet relatively under-recognized by bigger, more-established brands. As more players transition into e-commerce, the domain of private traffic has become quite saturated.", "Meanwhile, the algorithms of these social and e-commerce platforms, like Weibo, tend to squeeze content providers, such as brands and KOLs. These content providers are therefore forced to pay these gatekeepers or platforms to earn higher visibility and engagement. For example, the public traffic on Taobao and Tmall is mostly driven by content fuelled by livestreams, products on sale, and recommendations. Therefore public traffic is generally controlled by e-commerce sites and social media platforms, unlike private traffic.\u00a0", "In the context of luxury business, the possession of traffic is crucial for maintaining the social prestige of the brands. According to Pablo Mauron, Partner and Managing Director China at Digital Luxury Group, an international digital agency for luxury brands, what tends to define a luxury brand is the sales path and consumer journey. As Mauron explains, \u201cunless that traffic is owned by the brand, it will be difficult to plan activations around it.\u201d\u00a0", "Yet, private traffic is not something new to international luxury brands: When the term was yet to be defined, luxury sales assistants in China kicked off CRM (Customer Relationship Management) on WeChat as the app has taken on the functions of messages and emails. By adding valued customers on WeChat, previewing newly launched products and by addressing inquiries, sales assistants could (and do) construct intimate relationships with clientele through a series of exclusive services.\u00a0", "But, it was not until the COVID-19 outbreak that the draw of private traffic was fully understood. On the one hand, brands who adopt the private traffic model should narrow-down on promotional activities in the public domain, as many insiders highly recommend; On the other, they need to resort to digital selling to offset the offline sales drop-off seen during the crisis. In such cases, the importance of private traffic can not be overstated.\u00a0\u00a0", "Under quarantine, WeChat Moments, in particular, have transformed into online boutiques. Elena Zhou, a frequent luxury shopper in her early twenties has dozens of sales assistants on WeChat. She told Jing Daily that her moments are now filled with new products photos and descriptions posted by sales assistants. \u201cMost of their posts keep consistency with the brand\u2019s personality.\u201d However, she also pin-pointed the differences between boutique advisors and other sales-related accounts, adding, \u201ctheir moments are more boutique vibe than daigous \u2014 meaning they won\u2019t remind you of outlet-retail despite posting discounts or presale events.\u201d\u00a0", "Zhou continued stating that even sales advisors from some lower-profile luxury brands like Goyard have resorted to social selling on WeChat moments \u2014 most likely in response to the current climate of dropping sales. Multiple-angle photos tagged with retail prices, detailed product descriptions, and regular updates at least every other day have been appearing in her feeds.\u00a0", "The human-intensive workflow involved in the typical luxury CRM is also necessary for the maintenance of private traffic. While chat automation helpers such as WeTool and AI-powered chatbots have been invented to improve the efficiency of managing multiple group chats simultaneously, they are unable to fill the role of one-to-one conversations, especially in the luxury sector. After all, the invaluable personal connection with customers cannot be fully replaced by technology.\u00a0", "Yet, there are still alternatives of facilitating digitalization of CRM. As the WeChat ecosystem is becoming more self-contained and well-developed, users\u2019 data can be accessed if they follow brands\u2019 WeChat subscription accounts and service accounts. The key to winning WeChat, essentially, is to collect and manage users\u2019 data as this will result in a better understanding of customers, facilitate organic reach, and ideally, convert traffic into sales.\u00a0", "Many brands tend to be disappointed by the low follower count and low engagement of their WeChat official accounts. But brands need to be aware that the size of it\u2019s WeChat audience might not be the most relevant indicator of success. As Mauron explained to Jing Daily: \u201cBuilding broad, unqualified audiences on WeChat is irrelevant \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be a numbers game. In order to build a qualified community of clients and prospects on WeChat, it is therefore important for brands to develop value-added services on the platform, such as loyalty programmes and customer service solutions.\u201d", "WeChat Mini Programs, along with features such as livestream and Channels (short-videos) have flocked to the ecosystem, creating an infrastructure for those value-added services as well as capturing users in the WeChat database.

It was commonplace to spot them dressed in identikit clothing from brands like Canada Goose, Gucci, and Dior, hanging around the local luxury mall (Copley Place) as they swapped credit card swipes for the latest trends.", "Conscious of this fact, Sophia wanted to be more than a trend-follower. She went to get a business graduate degree and immersed herself in the luxury business category. When she returned to China, she started her career in the PR sector at a luxury management company where she helped the company to build a truly homegrown Chinese luxury brand. The dream was big and hard to achieve and the young returnee soon discovered the intricacies of navigating luxury on the mainland: \u201cIn China, luxury is about preserving culture and heritage\u2026 It\u2019s hard to capture the soul of this business and turn it into a profitable one.\u201d", "At one point in the conversation, Jin recalled a time when she attended a luxury retail event when the words of Laurent Claquin, President of Kering Americas, had a strong impact on shaping her outlook as a consumer.

Its functional pieces are minimalistic and transformable and are all locally-made with environmentally-friendly material.", "In China, one of my favorites is a local cashmere brand Vogo and I also love a perfume brand called Maison Francis Kurkdjian.

In the future, brands should be conscious of the current concerning issues in society like gender inequality or global warming. They also need to be community-engaging and provide an aspirational lifestyle or ignite a cultural movement.

In general, I think the virus will accelerate a lot of changes in consumption habits in China. E-commerce is so accessible here and stores that don\u2019t serve customers thoughtfully will lose their competitiveness. Retail spaces, however, will become a source of experiences beyond mere transactions.", "The COVID-19 virus has reset my thinking about the fashion industry and made me think about how unnecessary or how pointlessly wasteful it can be. I am an advocate of sustainable fashion and the outbreak of the virus only reinforces this idea. Comparatively speaking, luxury brands like Louis Vuitton that keep pushing out pop-up stores are rather superficial; this strategy doesn\u2019t create much meaning beyond showcasing quality-made products.", "Where were you when you heard the outbreak of the virus, how did you feel?", "I first spotted news about the virus from the Financial Times and then gradually read about it from Chinese media. You could see more and more people wearing masks on the street which spread a sense of hysteria and paranoia. Home-quarantine was recommended around the celebration of Chinese New Year dampening the holiday mood. However, beyond the heavy-hit Wuhan province in China, I could never have foreseen how the virus would impact global activities as it is now.", "Have you ventured outside since the outbreak of the virus? What changes have you noticed?", "I have been taking walks outside lately, about twice a week now. The Shanghai government has done an amazing job of controlling the situation.

During the outbreak, one of my favorite brands from the Shiseido group, IPSA, has been holding frequent online discussions amongst loyal customers. I was invited to the WeChat group by my beauty associate from the store and I found the activities there brought a sense of ritual to my life. They organize all kinds of events throughout the day: sharing beauty tips in the morning, make-up competitions in the afternoon, and showing off products around nighttime. As everyone is battling against the negative news, the associates online are being sensitive and upbeat so it\u2019s not a lot of hard-selling but more entertainment. Besides, it\u2019s a lot of fun just being part of a group at this time of isolation.", "Did any brand campaigns leave a strong impression on you amid the virus?", "I noticed many foreign brands acted quickly and supported the situation in Wuhan with donations whereas homegrown brands in China actually devised many purposeful campaigns. Chinese brands are more digitally savvy and have been seen to react to trends faster than global brands. It could also have to do with luxury brands\u2019 positioning, going online diminishes their privileged identity. But marketing-wise, I think more brands will thrive by being more tailored to individual needs, diving deeper into content commerce, and serving customers\u2019 values on a deeper level than simply products in-store.", "What would you like to buy once the situation recovers? When I went to the mall the other day to exchange a shopping voucher, the sales associate recommended a facial mask made by a Chinese brand Inoherb. It was high quality but pretty cheap, about $29 (200 yuan). My friend also recommended another Chinese beauty brand, Perfect Diary.

This trend has been gaining momentum since the 2000s but has mushroomed over the last couple of years as more brand names venture into the Chinese market.

But when it comes to China, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. \u201cIdeally, the long-term desire to develop a close relationship with an audience should be on a local level,\u201d adds Cavier. \u201cDesigners started with digital livestreaming from Western fashion weeks, and now, they step up to a physical presence.

But, he adds, \u201cNow, we organize it and, in the meantime, provide this message to millions of consumers around the world. So, you have to work with the key partners that provide you with a high level of visibility.\u201d As Jing Daily reported, topics about the show skyrocketed up Weibo\u2019s trending list, thanks to the presence of multiple celebrities, and the hashtag #daydreamvalentino was mentioned over 300 million times on the platform.

Rachel Arthur, co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer of the communications, marketing, and PR agency Current Global, sees the value in this and stresses the need to cater to \u201cunique tastes and demands\u201d and the \u201cimportance of the product.\u201d", "But Porteous urges caution to labels that want to incorporate Chinese design, culture, or heritage into a collection. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult tightrope to walk,\u201d he states. \u201cDo it right, and you build a strong emotional connection with consumers. But get it wrong, and you risk being seen as patronizing or not truly understanding China.\u201d He continues, adding that cultural elements must be included based on design merit rather than just commercial expediency, as those maneuvers are \u201coften transparent and rightly derided.\u201d", "Being authentic", "For Cavier, brand leaders need to tread carefully in general when in China. \u201cThere is often a backlash when entities are seen as pandering to the wishes of the Chinese Government,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balancing act, but ask yourself: Can they be aspirational in the market but also be absolutely upfront and above board? So many things can be misconstrued by an audience that can take sentiments to new levels.\u201d", "We have seen how many ill-judged luxury strategies can damage reputations. Dior managed to bounce back from its recent faux pas relatively quickly and with little harm done thanks to some insightful measures. Cavier\u2019s suggestions for countering unexpected issues are simple: connect locally, be careful, and act cautiously. Due to what he calls \u201cidiocracies in the market,\u201d the way companies articulate their brand activations in China must be very specific. Accordingly, they can be \u201cirreverent, creative, and push boundaries, but there are limits.\u201d", "Choosing the right online tech partners", "Claudia Verbost, Commercial Director of the China-focused marketing and e-commerce agency AgencyChina, confirms that the big e-commerce giants \u2014 including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance \u2014 are all fighting to win over Western luxury companies. \u201cOnline is so crucial in China,\u201d she states. \u201cTencent is making more attractive WeChat programs and drops, while Alibaba\u2019s Luxury Pavillion continues to impress, along with other initiatives.\u201d\u00a0 While runway shows will undoubtedly benefit from these alignments, according to Verbost, an important question remains: \u201cWhich platform is the best for your brand?\u201d", "Making mistakes offline will affect a brand\u2019s online decisions \u2014 if not now then down the line. Burberry is collaborating with Tencent in Shenzhen to open a \u201csocial retail store\u201d while Prada has chosen to go it alone by launching their own e-commerce shop. And while there\u2019s risk in choosing a platform, Verbost admits that any choice is ultimately a massive opportunity.", "Facing sustainability concerns head-on", "Given the current climate crisis, the thought of another luxury brand flying across the world to present a runway show sits uneasily with many consumers. Yet, the situation shouldn\u2019t be seen in black-and-white terms. Arthur suggests that, in time, issues like this will become a key consideration as sustainability becomes less siloed. \u201cRight now brands need to react to a shifting landscape and reach more consumers through any means possible,\u201d he notes. \u201cOpening more stores is no longer the easiest route to market, hence the physical show can boost growth. But we know there is a huge amount of environmental impact from shows. There is a carbon footprint, but you\u2019d hope these people are on the ground [in China] already, and I\u2019d imagine they will try to offset this.\u201d", "Brooke Roberts-Islam, a fashion tech and sustainability innovator, says that there are additional areas \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d where brands can look to be more ethical. \u201cThere are other areas that need to be targeted, sampling in design for one, he states. \u201cThere\u2019s an amount of waste on carbon emissions associated with that, and I\u2019d be interested to see how that stacks up against flights.\u201d", "Staying ahead of rapidly shifting trends", "Verbost, who has offices located in both Europe and China, adds that brands should also take heed of the speed factor in China. \u201cThe market requires quick movement,\u201d she states, \u201cso the fact that luxury companies are only stepping up their runway shows now, alongside the fact that China still isn\u2019t the first location but a secondary add-on, proves they\u2019re still too slow.\u201d She wonders if these big juggernauts can adapt to the needs of a post-90s generation, particularly when it seems like millennials are focusing on local independent designers. \u201cHaving only lived through the years in which China was experiencing double-digit growth and worldwide success, the Post-90s generation is proud to be Chinese and therefore also proud of the Chinese luxury lines that the country has to offer,\u201d she adds.", "Whether or not Western brands can move fast enough to stay up-to-date and on-trend over the next couple of years will likely indicate where mainland Chinese consumers will be spending their money."]}, {"title": "Why FOMO is Shaping the Luxury Market Now More Than Ever", "meta": "January 27, 2020", "paragraphs": ["There\u2019s always one recurring theme I see in my luxury masterclasses: Luxury managers are aware that their brands aren\u2019t prepared to be attractive or relevant to millennials today \u2014 at all. And while they struggle to adapt to changes that have already happened, the changes that are coming via Gen Z will far outpace what they\u2019ve already experienced. As a result, it will be critical for luxury brands to have the ability to anticipate what will happen over the next decade. That\u2019s because, according to research, luxury brands are only relevant to younger consumers if they are considered influential and innovative. Brands that are relegated to following the pack will quickly become irrelevant and will be replaced with zeitgeist-defining brands.", "How do we know this? Because of the consumer signals we receive. One of those signals, FOMO (a.k.a. fear of missing out) is what\u2019s driving Gen Zers \u2014 more specifically, the fear of not being relevant because they\u2019ve missed out on something culturally important. This is the feeling that will completely change the way brands \u2014 and even entire markets \u2014 operate in the future.", "Imagine that a suitcase company launched a new trolley, and because you weren\u2019t paying attention, you are now among those unlucky people who missed out on the latest fashion accessory. You may ask yourself: How did that happen?", "For decades, the suitcase market was one of the most traditional markets (even the most boring one, some say). Consumers bought a suitcase as a utility that would hopefully be used for an entire lifetime. Function and durability won over form every time.", "There were some exceptions, mostly due to material differentiation, but most businesses blindly followed the same century-old playbook. But now, within the last few months, everything in the industry has changed. Suitcases are becoming the new sneakers (meaning the hot collectible luxury purchase) thanks to new concept items like Rimowa\u2019s limited-edition collaboration with Christian Dior and Off-White\u2019s transparent trolley. Both products have upended the rules of the category while creating an incredible amount of value and price points the industry has never seen before ($4,000 for a cabin trolley, for instance).", "Some of these suitcases are so valuable, the owners don\u2019t even use them for travel. They\u2019ve become a must-have/a collectible/a work of art and, most importantly, they create FOMO. Suitcases evolved in less than a year from utilities to highly-sought-after fashion items for a season, for one trip, or even to sit at home. I know one owner of a limited-edition Rimowa suitcase who would rather postpone a flight than check his new luggage. The suitcase could be damaged and not available for the next trip. Thanks to FOMO, consumers are treating must-have possessions as even more valuable than they are", "When consumers experience FOMO, they start to follow everything the brand does in fear of missing out on future experiences. But to stimulate the desire to follow, brands must create content that keeps followers engaged. And to keep them engaged, there needs to be authenticity and relevance.", "But how do you create an authentic message? It\u2019s important to understand that it\u2019s the customer \u2014 not the brand \u2014 who decides what\u2019s authentic. If they evaluate the brand and its content as authentic, then it is. If they find it inauthentic: It is. Brand intentions don\u2019t matter. There\u2019s no such thing as becoming \u201dmore authentic.\u201d Authenticity is binary: Either a brand is perceived as authentic, or it\u2019s not.", "Once a brand is seen as authentic and its message resonates, then relevance is created. Only then will a consumer consider that brand, especially a young, urban Gen Zer. Authenticity drives a consumer\u2019s desire to follow a brand, their positive reactions create FOMO, and in turn, FOMO stimulates more people to follow the brand. It\u2019s a virtuous circle if done correctly, and it\u2019s a nightmare that destroys brands when it\u2019s done incorrectly.", "What should brands do to prepare for a decade of increasing FOMO at an accelerated pace? First, they need to be aware that consumer perceptions are changing rapidly. This rapid change reinforces the consumer\u2019s need for brands to be innovative and influential. Complacency will completely kill a luxury brand by 2030, as innovation and influence become more and more crucial.", "Many brands I speak with are unprepared for this change. They lack a comprehensive brand story that balances the brand\u2019s rational and emotional aspects or offers a clear purpose. The brand story is the base of all brand content, so if the brand story is weak, there\u2019s no way to guide the consumer. Without guidance, content becomes random and empty. Gen Zers will simply look elsewhere. As their influence increases, brands will have to refocus their brand storytelling, equity, and content.", "Real-time consumer insights will become a precondition to understanding the rapidly evolving views of consumers, and artificial-Intelligence based insight technologies will replace focus groups and traditional market research, as they lack precision and are too isolated or slow to work in today\u2019s quickly changing marketplace. Very few brands can generate and process real-time consumer insights today, but this will be essential in the future.", "FOMO on \u201dsteroids\u201d will separate the successful brands from those who fail. The influence of FOMO will force a completely different way of thinking onto brands. They must ask themselves: How can luxury brands become trendsetters? How can they create a desire in a specific moment? How can they involve more consumers? How can they add perceived coolness?

Moreover, the big four are now looking to Shanghai for innovation: In September 2019, the British Fashion Council started selling tickets to London Fashion Week \u2014 copying a pioneering move introduced by Shanghai.", "Key brand opportunity: This fashion week is a global-facing event with a growing reputation among domestic buyers, making it an indispensable landmark for brands wanting to crack the Chinese market. But, given the large volume of events both on and off schedule, the extensive competition, and the city\u2019s high level of sophistication, getting your brand to stand out is a big issue.", "When: Yearly. Next edition, March 2020", "Overview: The municipal government and the Shenzhen Industry Garment Association developed this platform to support their local designers, brands, and businesses. It aims to connect the production industry with research and development to unify fashion, particularly for domestic brands. Having run yearly since 2015, the event coincides with the trade show Shenzhen similarly to how Shanghai does with their trade show, Chic.", "IMG, the global management company, has helped to launch the event and currently consults the management committee. It has also brought with it a selection of American brands to participate, including Leanne Marshall, Cynthia Rowley, and Bibhu Mohapatra.", "Why it matters to China: Shenzhen has been uniquely developed for manufacturing and trade, and as one of the first Chinese cities open to the West (along with neighboring Hong Kong), it has become a vital hub of design innovation and production. IMG\u2019s Jennifer Taylor, VP of Global Consulting and Business Development, points out that, over the years, the city has been responsible for a tremendous amount of domestic manufacturing, and many global brands now source manufacturing in Shenzhen.", "Key brand opportunity: International brands can benefit in many ways from this event by making local manufacturing connections, building their network for distribution to the Chinese market, or increasing brand awareness. And while the Chinese marketplace presents some unique complexities for Western brands, the lure of potential growth undoubtedly attracts. \u201cShowing at Shenzhen Fashion Week and, therefore, participating in the Chinese retail landscape is a great introduction to the market,\u201d Taylor adds.", "When: Yearly, April and November", "Overview: Guangzhou Fashion Week, which was founded in 2003, is organized by the Guangzhou Fashion Designers Association and supported by the city\u2019s municipal commission of commerce.

For me personally, it was an opportunity to see the variety of fabric and textile factories being produced here at different scales.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: A tier-1 city and China\u2019s third-largest, Guangzhou is located close to both Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Like these cities, Guangzhou\u2019s long-held position as a production base means it can also offer brands access to large fabric wholesalers and markets. And while the event has yet to receive much global recognition, it\u2019s developing international ties by inviting brands from outside of China. Lawlor, who showed alongside several brands from the UK and Italy that were invited by Guangzhou fashion week, is optimistic about the event, saying, \u201cI think the international brands built some stable connections and the industry made orders. The level of investment was impressive and there are opportunities there \u2014 you just need to hunt for them.\u201d", "When: Yearly, March and October", "Overview: Beijing\u2019s China Fashion Week is the country\u2019s most established and longest-running fashion week. However, it has failed to make the international impact of its industry rival in Shanghai. First organized by the China Fashion Association in 1997, the fashion week has bet on China\u2019s domestic winners over its 22-year history through a combined total of 200-plus shows and events, including brands like Ne-Tiger, Yaying, and Uooyaa. This lineup includes brands from other domestic cities like Dalien alongside non-Chinese brands from over 20 countries.", "Why it matters to China: After the loss of international sponsor Mercedes Benz, China Fashion Week has struggled to attract attention both inside and outside of China. Now, having recently partnered with WWD China, it\u2019s showing a new effort to amplify its global reputation. As one of the last fashion weeks on the circuit, most buyers will have allocated budgets by the time it takes place, which means most brands showing there are dependent on the attendance of national buyers. However, given the volume of China\u2019s domestic market, that still equates to big business, and both the event and the China Fashion Association can look to increase its dominance on their home turf.", "Beijing is also home to Fashion Now: a separately-organized alternative showcasing platform that runs before China Fashion Week. It appeals specifically to niche, independent designers and the 14th edition will take place in late March 2020.", "Key brand opportunity: According to an organization insider, this fashion week offers participating brands unrivaled opportunities for press coverage and media exposure, as Beijing is the unofficial home of China\u2019s media. The roughly 500 media companies in attendance can propel an unknown brand into the mainland\u2019s consciousness in its first season.

As the home of brands ranging from large conglomerates like Anta Sports and Septwolves to young, independent designers such as Ms Min and Sankuanz, it\u2019s fitting that Xiamen would want its own fashion week. Established by the municipal government, the condensed event focuses on local brands like Jiwenbo and The MSLAN with a peppering of international talent.", "Why it matters to China: The event targets highly localized brands, but it invited brands from Beijing and Shanghai to showcase this year. Despite these efforts, Xiamen Fashion Week is still decidedly irrelevant to younger, designer brands like Sankuanz, Ms Min, and Deepmoss, all of which are local yet disengaged. Dido Liu, the designer behind Deepmoss, has been showing seasonally at Shanghai Fashion Week since 2015 and suggests the event needs more time. \u201cI think for Xiamen, it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cI think they have big plans, but for now, other fashion weeks are more advanced.

Not to be confused with the city\u2019s textile trade fair, Hong Kong Fashion Week, Centrestage has been running since 2016 and is based at the commercial Hong Kong Exhibition Centre. There it operates a trade-show/showroom experience that offers a bounty of fashion shows from local and invited designers that are primarily sourced from mainland China and Asia. It also plays host to the environmental NGO Redress Design Award, industry talks, and many knowledge-sharing initiatives.", "Why it matters to China: Centrestage aims to be the best fashion week in Asia and for Asia. The event invites established brands like Korea\u2019s Juun J and Japan\u2019s Facetasm but is also striving to become a hotbed for new talent. For Jarno Leppanen\u2019s emerging independent menswear brand Ka Wa Key, which is based in Hong Kong and London, the strategy is working. \u201cIt\u2019s a good combination of east meets west,\u201d he says. \u201cCenterstage is a brilliant gateway to the Asian market. I think it\u2019s a really useful platform for Hong Kong designers, and even though it competes with NYFW time-wise, it still manages to stand out as its own interesting event.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: With 50 offices globally, the HKTDC organizes a range of buying missions. Alongside local luxury retailers, close to 7,000 buyers from 74 countries and regions visited in 2019. For brands such as FFixxed Studios, the main attraction of the event is access to these buyers. \u201cThe year we took part, the organizers had really strong buyers, and due to the concise selection of talent, you are guaranteed they will look at your collection,\u201d says FFixxed co-founder Fiona Lau.

Dr. Frank Cintamani, Founding President of the Asian Couture Federation, affirms this, stating, \u201cAs an on-going initiative, we hope to create a singular platform, giving Asia a much needed focal point for the Asian couture industry, and, as such, this affords a unique opportunity to create new markets for couturiers in China.\u201d Also, its student-focused forum, aimed at demystifying and explaining the business of couture, adds value to the event.", "Key brand opportunity: The appeal of homegrown couture designers is rising in China, as celebrities and high-profile clients alike are turning to names like Pei and Grace Chen when making investment purchases. VIPs and mostly Beijing-based media attended the event, and it was broadcast on CCTV to over 600 million viewers, which means access to a stream of potential new clients.

London can become a second home after finishing their studies, visa permitting.

But moves like these are generally restrained. As a buyer, Petersson explains that schedule-hopping from the bigger brands can cause issues for younger labels. \u201cIt gets more complicated when one of the bigger brands goes off and decides to show in another city whilst one city is already starting to show,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is sometimes detrimental to the younger brands that tend to get the slots on the first or last day and are more likely to be affected by this.\u201d", "She suggests it can be good for younger brands to experiment, though, as this not only adds excitement to a schedule but has practical benefits. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that young designers are trying out new cities to get a feel for where they are best suited, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s especially beneficial where the label is established in an \u2018off-schedule\u2019 city like Shanghai, where you won\u2019t benefit from the full force of international buyers.\u201d", "Backstage at 8on8 FW20.

For Chinese menswear, it\u2019s like a test to get feedback.

Xander Zhou, Sanquanz, and Sean Suen were all early recipients of their support (the latter two have moved on from the London show). This season, the GQ China Presents platform supported 8ON8\u2019s \u201cWait Rose!\u201d collection, which was a play on the U.K.\u2019s Waitrose supermarket. \u201c8ON8 will stay in London, it works for us here,\u201d explains designer Li Gong. \u201cIt\u2019s the most creative place for me, and I\u2019ve got a connection [to it].\u201d Last season, 8ON8 showed at Pitti, which Li admires, but \u201cLondon pips it for creativity.\u201d", "Backstage at Pronounce FW20.

The company has worked with other Chinese clients as well, such as VIP.com and Izzue, and Blonstein believes that many Chinese brands are outshining their London counterparts. \u201cThe standard that\u2019s coming out of China is at a Parisian level,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the tailoring to the casting, it is exceptional and impacting what British designers are offering.\u201d But, as she points out, they aren\u2019t usually integrated into the local scene. \u201cSadly, brands can struggle with the guest list, as there\u2019s often a lack of interest,\u201d she states. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why brands decide to hop around fashion weeks?\u201d", "Feng Chen Wang, who recently returned to London from the NYFW schedule, wasn\u2019t lacking in attendees, despite being scheduled for the final day.

Ka Wa Key has shown in London, Finland, New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai thus far. \u201cLondon has a great atmosphere, but it\u2019s getting smaller. It has fewer designers, buyers, press, and interest. This year, we go back to New York in February. It\u2019s a great city with great energy,\u201d he states.", "Like Ka Wa Key, most Chinese designers on the LFWM schedule featured women\u2019s looks as part of their collections in London, further threatening the stability of schedules. London\u2019s incubator Fashion East recently dropped its prestigious MAN platform, adding it into its women\u2019s sponsorship. Moreover, fashion weeks in Asia are usually mixed-gender. Former GQ Presents recipient, the US-based Private Policy, has gone one step further and switched to a womenswear schedule, presenting at NYFW in February. \u201cWe want to try a different fashion week schedule and keep exploring genderless fashion,\u201d explains co-designer, Siying Qu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to limit buyers or consumers but want them to feel comfortable.\u201d And while they are now, admittedly, \u201cfirmly embedded\u201d in New York, past slots at LFWM were useful. \u201cIt was a way to have more presence in Europe and open up the market with some shows,\u201d Qu adds. \u201cWe met with retailer Selfridges and now they carry us. London men\u2019s is very vibrant and exciting, and the city is still on the brand\u2019s radar. Our next plan for London will not be during fashion week, rather, we are looking for opportunities to present differently, like in a popup or a store.\u201d", "While it certainly affords emerging designers the freedom to experiment, according to Tomorrow\u2019s Lee, schedule-hopping is not ideal. \u201cI think for some established brands it\u2019s interesting to show in different places. But for young emerging designers, it can be confusing to the industry when a brand keeps swapping around.\u201d Since launching with GQ China, Xander Zhou has consistently shown at LFWM. This season, his conceptual designs exploring multiverses and inclusivity showcased a level of maturity that Lee considers integral to having a solid base. \u201cNow, after four or five years, we really know the brand,\u201d Lee says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good model for young, emerging Chinese designers to adopt.\u201d", "Xander Zhou FW20 Runway.

Ka Wa Key suggested it wasn\u2019t ideal for them, while the London-based duo Dan Shan, who are former regulars at LFWM, opted for a break, instead opting for a showroom at Pitti Immagine Uomo and a show in Shanghai. The Guangzhou-born Danxia Liu, one half of the label explains, saying, \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a better timeline to show later. Also, if you show in March or April, you have more chances of standing out. The buyers have a fresh memory. It\u2019s a bit more likely they won\u2019t forget what they have seen.\u201d", "What\u2019s clear is that showing internationally is important for brands back home \u2014 regardless of the place or timing. Standing out is vital, and Asian fashion weeks have a much lower MIV impact than London: An internal report by Launchmetrics stated that across Western channels, SS20 could be valued as follows: $8.2 million in Tokyo, $5.6 million in Seoul, and $2.1 million in Shanghai. As Yu suggests, showing internationally carries \u201cprestige\u201d for Chinese designers, and in this regard, designers need to break out and compete on the global stage. \u201cChinese consumers appreciate designers who are gaining recognition abroad and are keen to support and celebrate their success,\u201d she adds. \u201cChinese designers could make this a key part of their marketing strategy.\u201d", "On the ground level, brands like Dan Shan are writing a new rulebook by being flexible. Liu is confident that when choosing where to show, brands don\u2019t have to follow pre-existing routes. \u201cThese days, it simply doesn\u2019t really matter where you show or even what time.

Given this, here are Jing Daily\u2019s six predictions for the 2020 Chinese luxury market.", "Brands will be more culturally sensitive to the Chinese market", "2019 was a series of brand missteps in the Chinese market. From Versace and Coach to Tiffany and Dior \u2014 all long beloved by Chinese customers \u2014 brands have been heavily criticized for cultural insensitivity towards China.

Their formulas which include a distinctive DNA, grass-root marketing, and constant revision of product formula due to consumer demand, are drastically different to luxury brands with who have a controlled brand image, precise merchandizing and trendsetting design. In China, homegrown brands and Taobao vendors will react to consumer brands both in design and customer service terms. Already, local brand Perfect Diary communicated with consumers and reacted to the latest social trends by dropping special editions. While luxury brands may not become entirely D2C, they can utilize their marketing strategies. User-generated content will become an irreversible trend, whether that\u2019s in customized products or social media engagement.

For example, Chinese citizens are now more welcoming to the concept of gender binary; when unisex style emerged in China fifteen years ago, the lack of boundaries between females and males was heavily criticized whereas now it is more tolerable. Trends are now moving towards gender-inclusivity and as brands like Supreme, uncovered by millennials, go mainstream, exclusivity, diversity, and authenticity will be the keywords for future Gen Zers.", "Rental fashion and pre-own goods will become more popular\u00a0", "The rental fashion and luxury resale market in China will keep growing. Young Chinese consumers don\u2019t attach a stigma to second-hand goods and set less ownership towards commodities. Moreover, issues such as sustainability, affordability and a move towards retro-design aesthetics, will entice younger generations to opt for pre-owned goods. Inspired by this, luxury brands, too, will look to their archives and launch iconic re-editions of past designs.

While luxury brands strive to maintain their positioning through a combination of history and legacy, younger consumers prefer statements that resonance with their lives today. Some principal players have leveraged the intersection between contemporary art and fashion to explore the socio-cultural issues that resonate with young consumers, for example, Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cComing of Age,\u201d curated by Virgil Abloh.

For example, Marie Dalgar partnered with the CCTV documentary series \u201cNational Treasure\u201d for a limited-edition lipstick and built a well-earned reputation among consumers for championing Chinese heritage. Collaborations don\u2019t even need to be in the realm of high culture as long as it will reach the masses in popular spaces\u2014similarly to Cheetos\u2019 beauty-focused marketing campaign in Western social media circles, China\u2019s Marie Dalgar worked with KFC in 2017 for advertising campaigns that generated 12 million RMB in revenue over three days and 1.4 million visits to Marie Dalgar\u2019s Tmall store.", "2. Product Launches around Trending Topics In a similar vein, one of the beauty marketing trends you don\u2019t want to miss is that beauty brands are leveraging trending conversation topics and memes for marketing campaigns. Everyone creates special products to tie in with Chinese holidays\u2014above all, for Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival\u2014and e-commerce events like Singles\u2019 Day. Now, brands are riding on a broader range of events and conversations, hoping they can attract some of the spotlights for themselves. In recent years, a number of brands have released Spring Festival campaigns engaging sincerely with some of the serious issues and dilemmas young people face around the holiday when tensions can run high with family visits. For example, SK-II\u2019s 2019 Spring Festival campaign addressed the pressure many unmarried Chinese women face when they return home.", "", "Exemplary case studies prove that brands can be bold and cross into new product categories in their collaborations. For example, Marie Dalgar teamed up with brewing giant Heineken and Tmall earlier this year to release a \u201cforgiveness\u201d gift box. The gift box was released on Tmall\u2019s \u201cFans Day\u201d to coincide with the European Champions\u2019 League soccer final, which Heineken sponsors.

Out of a limited edition run of 3,000 units, Marie Dalgar sold 1,000 units within 10 minutes. The campaign reached 62 million consumers online, with a total of 50 million engagements.", "Brands don\u2019t need to try to turn every trending topic into a discussion about themselves. A great social team may have the wit to score regular hits with a range of topics, but those who are too eager will look desperate, if not inappropriate. Instead, brands should start by combing the calendar for annual and upcoming events that align with their products or values. This could mean cultural and sporting events, awards shows, festivals, and concerts. It could mean paying attention to what\u2019s big in the culture, from celebrities, memes, and slang, to TV shows and movies. From there, it\u2019s all about getting creative and exploring what the brand can add to the discussion, how it can work with KOLs to do so, and how that can lead to conversions.", "3. Fresh Faces Several years after they first emerged, the first wave of \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d stars like Lu Han and Kris Wu are now household names.

Creative New Retail Era Beauty brands are exploring new concepts in the space between traditional boutiques and online commerce. Marie Dalgar was the first beauty brand to launch a vending machine specifically for beauty products, but this approach has proved popular, and a number of other beauty brands have subsequently adopted the format.

Private Traffic is King Previously, we talked about how brands can leverage private traffic to gain more \u201cKey Opinion Customers\u201d (KOCs) and boost their ROI. This strategy is especially suited for the beauty category, where customers are often making repeat purchases and tend to have an unlimited amount of talking points, from questions about ingredients to tips on how to apply products. Perfect Diary is a model example of a brand that has capitalized on \u201cprivate traffic\u201d by cultivating thousands of devoted brand fans across hundreds of WeChat groups dedicated to fostering exclusive conversations and information around its products.", "Beauty brands shouldn\u2019t miss out on this opportunity. They can either initiate consumer communities on one-to-one messaging platforms like WeChat or QQ on their own or leave it to KOLs to form their own networks of KOCs around niche subjects. Sometimes, customers might start these communities on their own in the West, Glossier has a huge collection of brand fans on Reddit, some of whom pose genuine questions and share feedback around various products. Glossier ambassadors and influencers are also active in these circles, sharing creative makeup ideas using specific products like this face chart.", "The best part?

Experiences Endure If any proof was needed, Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s \u201cBeauty Hotel\u201d pop-up last year showed the enduring power of experiential marketing, which is considered to be one of the top beauty marketing trends in 2020. A novel, imaginative and well-executed offline event can both bring a brand alive to new consumers, and reaffirm the brand\u2019s value to existing customers.

According to the Mckinsey China Luxury Report 2019, due to an increased level of sophistication younger Chinese consumers have started to appreciate more nuanced elements including design, fabric, and the production process; a good and recognizable design becomes the first step to establish the reputation of a handbag and facilitates a potential take-off.", "The importance of design is especially true when considering a brand\u2019s fallout. Even brands like Louis Vuitton will struggle to launch a new handbag if the design fails to connect. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the product and brand first. It is the very rare exception that an unpopular brand and or a bad product will ever become an \u2018It\u2019 product,\u201d says Elijah Whaley, former CMO, current advisor at PARKLU, China\u2019s Premier Influencer Marketing Platform.

According to Daniel Zipser, Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company, Leader of Greater China Consumer and Retail Practice, bags normally have English or French names that are not easy to pronounce. \u201cWith easier nicknames, people tend to talk about them more both on social media and in daily life. With Chinese nicknames, purchasers get to know the story and the uniqueness of the bag better.\u201d", "Currently, most handbag\u2019s nicknames are based on appearance, transliteration, translation or pop culture references. JW Anderson\u2019s Pierce bag was given the name, Bull Demon King Bag (\u201c\u725b\u9b54\u738b\u5305\u201d) due to its similarity in shape to a character from the Chinese Classical Novel Journey to the West, which increased the social buzz around this bag. The Drew bag, considered the most iconic design from Chlo\u00e9 in China, received the name \u201c\u5c0f\u732a\u5305\u201d for the similarity in pronunciation of Drew and the Chinese character \u201d\u732a\u201d (zh\u016b), and the similarity between the shape of the bag and a pig head. Ultimately, the goal is to make a bag easier to remember or refer to and adding more fun to the name adds even more value. But, perhaps, the biggest gain from nicknames can be seen culturally. As much luxury consumption on the mainland is socially driven, casually referring to handbags by nicknames in conversations highlights a touch of sophistication among peer groups. \u201cUsing the nickname itself shows that he or she knows the latest trend of fashion and is a luxury insider,\u201d adds Zipser.", "KOLs and Celebrity Endorsement Are Huge Drivers\u00a0", "According to the Tmall report, \u201cRankings on Chinese Celebrities in Driving Sales,\u201d in 2018 the keyword \u201ccelebrity style\u201d (\u201c\u660e\u661f\u540c\u6b3e\u201d) received over 100 million searches on Tmall. Brands who want to create an It bag should not miss out on vital celebrity and KOL strategies; in fact, on the mainland, trusted celebrities and KOLs connect better with consumers than brands. As Parklu\u2019s Whaley explains, China\u2019s younger generations identify strongly with KOLs who look and sound like them or a version they aspire to. \u201cOnce trust is established, a KOL\u2019s followers can be extremely receptive to the advice and endorsements the KOL delivers through their content, and by extension, willing to lend trust to the brands that KOLs promote.\u201d", "At the end of 2018, Mr. Bags shared a WeChat article asking readers what bags they purchased based on his recommendations.

Whaley summarises, \u201cAs important as KOLs are in generating top-of-the-funnel awesomeness, they are only one part of a larger whole that starts with great products and ends with happy consumers. Any weaknesses in the chain will lessen the likelihood of success.\u201d", "User-Generated Content Acts More Quickly in Catching Up A Trend\u00a0", "Besides the more official voices of KOLs and celebrities, user-generated content in 2019 has been a driving force in the creation of an It bag \u2014 namely for its ability to create and escalate a trend, quickly. The re-edition of Prada\u2019s Hobo bag launched in Paris and London earlier this year; it received over 1,700 notes on Little Red Book, yet WeChat seemed was slow to tap the trend. It mentioned less than 90 times. Brands should also monitor real-time reflections of popularity and be nimble enough to understand a trend and capitalize on the rise in demand by promoting it.", "A unique and recognizable design appears universal in the rise of an It bag. But as is often the case in China, the road to securing a successful or iconic design is manifold. As Chinese consumers approach luxury consumption from a highly socially-driven mindset, additions to the product that adds more social value including nicknames, celebrity and KOL strategies, and user-generated content, all act as a major factor in boosting the potential success of a handbag."]}, {"title": "Gen Z Has Made \u2018Social Currency\u2019 a Must-Have for Brands", "meta": "December 9, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Gen-Z consumers and the brands that are highly relevant to them are of utmost importance for two reasons.

Social currency is the result of brands building equity, not in a traditional way (advertising) but by creating an aura of strong desirability with the target audience. To do this, brands must radically rethink their approach. A precondition is understanding what consumers want. To do that, real-time insights generated from advanced data processing technologies and artificial intelligence are key.", "This is where hard data and creativity converge! The data is needed to dissect and filter consumer insights and identify trending topics, content, and relevant influencers (e.g. which rapper is best for the brand). Then, creativity is applied to create exciting experiences for customers and the media to spread around the world. But brands must also remember: The sneaker Adidas presented in Miami with an American rapper will be a hit with young Chinese customers because it\u2019s the shoe to wear this season.

With challenges coming from both inside and outside the business, will Plum be able to step up and take the title of China\u2019s version of The RealReal?", "In China, consumer sentiment towards second-hand retail is shifting. While older generations attach a stigma to second-hand goods, younger generations are significantly more open to them. Meanwhile, an abundance of luxury goods located in the country is setting the stage for a prosperous second-hand market. For generations of Chinese, second-hand goods are associated with poverty and poor quality, particularly for Gen Xers and older millennials who have experienced the socioeconomic transition.

It is still a modest number compared to the $6 billion US resale luxury market from 2018, but based on the fact that the yearly growth rate exceeded 20 percent over the last four years, the report anticipates an upgrading trend will continue.", "The growing acceptance of pre-owned goods and a more regular secondary market in China has prepared the country for Plum, but it\u2019s not enough to build up a mature trading chain without having the capability to speak to the domestic market. To make up for the supply deficiency during its initial stages, Plum is selling popular vintage bags and jewelry from luxury brands like Chanel and Dior via collaborations with Japanese vintage retailers. The supply from Japan not only enriches the inventory but also establishes the authenticity of merchandise on site. As Plum attracts many well-traveled Chinese consumers who are big fans of vintage luxury and frequent visitors to Japanese vintage stores, the platform should build up its reputation among experienced vintage shoppers. But for consumers who are new to the secondary market, the conditions and details of pre-owned items are their main concerns. Plum has thus incorporated a livestreaming feature as an efficient and powerful way to showcase items remotely. Consumers can interact with livestreaming hosts, ask for a detailed presentation, and even purchase the item while watching the livestream.", "It\u2019s the right time to break into the market, but the most critical issue awaiting Plum is how to drive sustainable circulation. Featuring a very similar consumer to business to consumer (C2B2C) model as The RealReal, Plum is positioned as an intermediate platform that connects consumers who exchange goods. Both sites aim at authenticating merchandise they receive from consignors while handling all sales processes, including photography, cataloging, pricing, stocking, and returns. They earn a certain percentage of consignors\u2019 commission fees for sustaining this operation.", "While the RealReal\u2019s commission structure consists of tiered commission rates based on the values of the items and their consignor loyalty program, Plum charges a 20 percent commission rate for all items across the board. The RealReal also only accepts luxury brands, but unlike Plum, offers consignors higher commission rates for higher-price items. By contrast, Plum\u2019s one-rate-fits-all policy is less compelling in motivating high-value merchandise consignments such as watches, jewelry, and high-priced handbags. Meanwhile, The RealReal delivers the message that \u201cthe more you consign the more you earn\u201d to clients through its VIP program. Though Plum features a privileged membership that offers extra discounts for shopping, the program cannot organically increase customer stickiness and has nothing to do with the supply side, which is the most important driver of the resale business.", "Plum must furnish clients with satisfying consignment experiences.

Since China is the youngest of the large luxury markets (millennials and Gen Zers account for roughly 80 percent of luxury consumption, with a sweet spot age bracket of 25-35 years old), their consumers are more open to trying new brands, and for those consumers, country of origin is now less important than brand storytelling and the ability to create value for buyers.", "\u201cAs the Chinese economy shifts inward, McKinsey predicts between $22 trillion and $37 trillion of economic value\u2014or between 15% and 26% of global gross domestic product\u2014could disappear as supply chains shrink and other changes ripple through the global economy,\u201d says Wernau in her Wall Street Journal article.

First, they shouldn\u2019t underestimate China. Too many brands still simply take their Western business model and implement it in China \u2014 and the results are almost always disastrous.

Many brands struggle when targeting younger customers, and then their consumer base, revenue, and profits quickly erode.

Agility and decisiveness are imperative today, and a brand must have dynamic content creation, particularly for Chinese customers.", "Second, brand storytelling can only be relevant, authentic, and effective if the brand first knows what the target group is talking about.

According to Marie Tulloch, Senior Client Services Manager and Chinese marketing consultancy Emerging Communications, \u201cThe idea that commercially driven recommendations cannot be identified by consumers is slightly naive. Overly polished or complex communication that is designed to have reach is usually seen for what it is.\u201d", "From the business side, for brands looking to break into the Chinese market, the soaring costs of popular KOLs are often unattainable. The value of paying KOLs to promote your product hinges on the number of followers they have, and top KOLs are even able to charge for promotional comments on other accounts. In addition, agencies working on behalf of KOLs have been found to\u00a0buy fake views\u00a0for promoted posts in order to charge higher fees and ensure KPIs are met.", "To add insult to injury,\u00a0recent celebrity scandals\u00a0have resulted in Chinese consumers boycotting the luxury brands certain influencers promote. Adam Knight, Co-Founder of digital marketing agency Tong Digital told\u00a0Jing Daily, \u201cConsumers\u2019 trust in their favorite KOLs has been undermined by a series of scandals and a bottoming out of the market in terms of quality and reliability. Platforms have been slow to deal with this, with the exception of Xiaohongshu, and the various measures it has taken to crack down on trashy influencer content and bogus micro-KOLs.\u201d", "Enter, the KOCs. They are everyday consumers, whose value is based on their relatability, and trustworthy nature. The entire focus of KOCs is on product reviews, yet often, they only have a few hundred followers on their accounts. For millennial Chinese consumers, this personable, friend-like appeal can have a powerful impact on purchasing decisions.", "\u201cMany brands, particularly Chinese domestic brands, have been using KOC marketing for quite some time,\u201d according to Lauren Hallanan, Head of Marketing at the Chinese marketing consultancy Chatly, \u201cIt is actually one of the key components of\u00a0Perfect Diary\u2019s marketing plan\u00a0that has helped them become one of the top cosmetics brands in China. In the early days, they began working with KOCs on a mass scale. This made it appear to the average consumer that the brand was quite popular because everyone was talking about it.\u201d", "Due to KOCs notable lack of followers, the luxury retail and lifestyle platform Little Red Book (Xiaohongshu) is proving itself to be the ideal place for KOC marketing. While KOC marketing can be done on any social media platform, the Xiaohongshu model appears to work best at promoting lesser-known accounts, \u201cXiaohongshu\u2019s algorithm seems to actually favor smaller accounts, and often makes their posts show up more in the main feed.\u201d says Hallanan., \u201cIn addition, the more Xiaohongshu users are talking about a certain brand or product, the more likely it will appear in the search results for that product category.\u201d", "Unlike other social platforms, Little Red Book not only shows content from accounts that they follow, but themes and hashtags related to the content they view and search. It is because of this that posts from users with only a few hundred followers can \u2018go viral\u2019 and be viewed by thousands \u2014 or even millions \u2014 of potential consumers.", "So how can brands harness the power of KOC influencer marketing? For one, it is important to note that KOCs cannot completely replace KOLs. \u201cThe value of KOL marketing is based on KOLs filtering content on behalf of followers and only relaying relevant information. They discriminate on behalf of audiences, and they are trusted for this, not for the fact that they provide completely independent recommendations,\u201d says Tulloch. A holistic marketing strategy is needed, with Hallanan commenting, \u201cBrands still need to work with top-tier and mid-tier influencers for the authority and clout.\u201d", "However, KOC influencers seem here to stay, and for many smaller brands they are the ideal first step into the Chinese market. At a recent event, Tong Digital presented a five-step process of \u201cproduct seeding\u201d to attract KOCs. The process begins with identifying potential KOCs and sending out gifted products. Next, the brand hopes to gather free exposure from KOC reviews and arrange future KOC paid campaigns with those that worked well. Finally, brands should look to formalize KOC partnerships with bigger post-campaign marketing. This low-risk high-reward technique means that brands are only paying out for the product and shipping costs, whilst testing the waters for what could be a lucrative marketing strategy.", "So, KOCs might be the latest cool kids on the social influencer block, and one for marketers to seriously consider. However, brands should be wary of putting all of their eggs in one basket. According to Tulloch, \u201cThe key point about KOLs, KOCs, micro-influencers, or anyone of any other level of following is the relevance of the person, audience, message, and channel.

In China, the fastest way to communicate wealth and status is through a branded or logoed item, which is why Chinese consumers became smitten with logos.

Indeed, logomania in China can primarily be linked to the triumph of hip-hop culture and its related streetwear aesthetic. Younger Chinese consumers believe that brands like Supreme and Off-White make logos cool because they remove the elitist connotations, as Gen-Z consumers aren\u2019t focused on communicating wealth through branded merchandise and logos.

Since truly luxurious products for the global aristocracy fall outside their price brackets, these consumers seek out legitimate alternatives, such as smaller luxury items like Chanel umbrellas with the CC logo.

Consequently, after years of negative press, many professionals forgot about the positive benefits of licensing and how it can create win-win situations.

Therefore, this trend has accelerated a return to licensing on one hand while also enhancing event-oriented collaborations.", "According to Steven Ekstract, Brand Director at Informa Markets, collaborations are a type of licensing. \u201cFor the luxury marketplace, these collaborations are usually limited run drops and specifically designed to create a buzz around the brands participating,\u201d Ekstract says. \u201cThe limited run makes them difficult to get and therefore in higher demand.\u201d", "Why licensing is a vital process for the future of luxury", "As Fashionbi notes, \u201ceyewear and cosmetics are the most licensed product groups in the fashion and luxury industry,\u201d and eyewear companies like Luxottica and Safilo have become major players in the eyewear licensing business because of their partnerships with luxury brands such as Dior, Chanel, Ralph Lauren, and Tiffany& Co.", "Most consumers see cosmetics and eyewear as a gateway to the world of luxury because these goods come at a lower price point.

Instead, they need to tell their customers what unique value they create specifically for them by the things they do exceptionally well.", "In luxury, it\u2019s about them (customer-centricity), not us (internal capabilities). Exceptional craftsmanship only creates value if there is a perceivable distinction between other luxury brands, and if this distinction can be expressed as a value proposition towards the customer. When we help clients to create new brands or sharpen and turnaround existing brands, we always define the brand\u2019s value proposition from the customer perspective. Especially for Millennials and Gen Zers consumers who expect this the most.", "To create a value proposition, brands need to provide a rational and an emotional benefit. Both are important and need to be a consistent part of the brand story. Few brands, however, have clarity around their emotional core, their purpose, and the way how they inspire their customers. What I often see is that they express, as their emotional positioning, the creation of dreams. The problem with this is: Unless the dream is explicitly defined, it seldom will create any customer value, and it won\u2019t differentiate the brand. More precision is needed.", "As a result, we typically find brands that are talking to themselves about themselves and in an imprecise way, and not differentiating enough from their competitors.

McKinsey\u2019s 2019 assessment of this phenomenon leaves no doubt who will be behind this future rise, making the observation that, \u201cChina\u2019s affluent post-1980s generation is fuelling luxury buying right now. They grew up as China emerged as an economic power and are now at the peak of their career and earnings.\u201d", "But while the demand for exclusive goods is primed by economic growth and the generational shift to a younger audience, this is only part of the story. According to GOAT\u2019s Lu, their recent $100 million investment from Footlocker will be used to push into the Chinese market with an acute awareness of the need for cultural specificity. To capture the attention of collectors of limited Yeezys and Jordans, brands require a native offering that eschews cookie cutter approaches. Lu commented,\u201dWe know China is a unique market and if we use the same strategy as the U.S., we\u2019ll likely fail.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are building this product with a local team in order to provide the Chinese consumer with a better, more personalized experience.\u201d", "It\u2019s a view shared by StockX\u2019s CEO, Scott Cutler, whose estimate for the billion-dollar company is that \u201c20% of the market is in Asia, with about 11% of that in China.\u201d Cutler suggests, \u201cwe already have a material amount of our buyers coming from China,\u201d and although much of this is in English, the future looks different. Cutler reveals, \u201cWe\u2019re introducing local payment methods later on this year. We\u2019ve got Alipay and we are working quickly to be able to launch a native, localized language experience. We see tremendous growth (as we\u2019re able to provide localized support and localized payments) in providing a native Chinese experience.\u201d", "Cutler is clear that there are several distinct reasons for the growth of this market, and so for the need to cater to young Chinese buyers. Primarily, Cutler observes, the strength of the Chinese economy is at the root of streetwear\u2019s popularity. \u201cObviously there\u2019s the rise of the stronger consumer in China over the last decade.\u201d But, he continues, \u201cthere\u2019s also been a really significant rise in certain brands in sports and fashion. So, the NBA\u2019s an example of a really strong presence in China. After Yao Ming there has been a lot more Chinese who embraced that world and began following players and teams. So, sneakers, in that example, are an outgrowth of sports.\u201d This love for the NBA, which now has 150 million Chinese social media followers, is mirrored in brand popularity for Chinese buyers on StockX, which he ranks in order as \u201cJordan, Adidas, Nike, Supreme.\u201d", "Alex James, founder of the streetwear brand Pleasures, spoke at Shanghai\u2019s Innersect conference of how this broadening of appeal has also been enabled by the way \u201cthe government has really loosened up over the years.\u201d According to James, even outside of Shanghai and Hong Kong, the whole scene is driven further by \u201crappers in the US, K-Pop stars in Korea, rappers in Japan.\u201d For him, spending is now occurring across limited edition, luxury brands, and vintage, because, \u201cpeople want to mix together different influences and show what they\u2019re into.\u201d", "For luxury brands with similar desires to increase their appeal in this market, then an attention to the cultural interests of their target demographic must be considered. Likewise, in addition to the content, consumption of high-end goods is driven by the delivery method. StockX\u2019s Scott Cutler sees the role of social media as crucial. \u201cWhen we see Chinese influencers would wear a particular brand of shoe and highlight that on social media, we\u2019re able to see a significant and almost immediate demand for that particular sneaker. Then people go out to try and find it; where can I find that shoe, who has that available.\u201d Part of the success of companies like StockX and GOAT then derives from the fact that, as Cutler relates, \u201cthose shoes are always available, they\u2019re never sold out.\u201d", "What can be learned from the growth of street wear and exclusive footwear is that Chinese Gen Z and millennial buyers respond to brands that offer them limited edition goods in a way that grants them constant access through their own preferred communication channels. Perhaps the final insight though belongs specifically to companies like GOAT and StockX as it concerns the issue of authenticity. According to Pointer Brand Protection\u2019s Fiona Gao, one problem that may have hampered the growth of many luxury brands in China has been the lack of a trusted infrastructure.", "Gao suggests, \u201cPeople know that the supply chain is already compromised by fakes and that limited availability invariably leads to counterfeits. For consumers who really want these exclusive products, this has proved off-putting.\u201d This may be one of the reasons for StockX\u2019s position in Asia according to Cutler. \u201cThe fact that we stand in the middle and authenticate drives trust and transparency to a much higher degree, so we\u2019re the first stop for buyers in the marketplace looking for these items.\u201d", "Ultimately, the gamble being taken on Chinese expansion by companies like GOAT may succeed for just this reason, and it may also prove profitable for other brands who can learn from their lesson. Gao continues, \u201cfor brands to succeed they should see the development of trust-based marketplaces as something to emulate. If they can provide similar guarantees of authenticity at every stage in a product\u2019s lifecycle then they may also be able to increase trust and sales.\u201d Whether luxury brands are ready to offer verification services to resold items is unclear given their desire to limit availability, but the market will be watching closely for how well GOAT, StockX, and others proceed with the marketing of their trusted exclusivity."]}, {"title": "Exclusive Interview: Bvlgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin", "meta": "September 4, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Italian luxury brand Bvlgari has spent the last 15 years steadily developing a strong foothold and consumer awareness in both Hong Kong and mainland China.

For example, high-end jewelry would include the entire production process as well as the buyer\u2019s history. This full transparency together with the product\u2019s DNA and authenticity would be fully available to the buyer. This could be extremely important for luxury customers who are looking to purchase items that are prestigious and valuable, and not just expensive.

Not only that, they use digital storytelling to communicate their craftsmanship and value, but they also develop engaging experiences that link online and offline channels. In other words, a successful heritage marketing strategy requires the strengthening of the brand equity and this is done by fully leveraging the power of social media platforms.

Consequently, Chinese consumers saw Cha Ling as a brand that uplifts its own qualities (including the heritage component) by acknowledging Eastern cultural values. Furthermore, at no point in time, does Cha Ling or LVMH ridicule Chinese values by employing a subordinate-superior relationship in which European heritage and craftsmanship become principal assets, but rather it venerates the rich Chinese history, transforming it into the company\u2019s greatest equity. In contrast, Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s tone-deaf Eating with Chopsticks campaign proves how an European brand that is too focused on its own history (think the \u201cItalianit\u00e0\u201d promoted by Dolce\u00a0& Gabbana) becomes unusually rigid in its marketing strategy and incapable to embrace and understand foreign cultural elements.", "Dropping an ill-advised marketing campaign on the luxury audience can have devastating outcomes.

Since entering in a partnership agreement with the world\u2019s largest food company, Hsu Fu Chi International Limited\u00a0maintained its prime position on the Chinese market through clever marketing campaigns that leveraged the power of heritage marketing. China Daily says that: \u201cWith television serials about the Qing Dynasty period, such as The Story of Yanxi Palace and Ruyi\u2019s Royal Love in the Palace proving popular among the younger generation last year, Hsu Fu Chi has developed a series of royalty-and palace-themed entertainment content and gift packs.\u201d", "Evidently,\u201cemphasizing popular traditional elements\u201d is a successful marketing strategy. In this case, the brand crafts an engaging story around an exclusive world giving its consumer base the premise to start a conversation. And then again, by engaging buyers, the brand builds a long-lasting emotional connection.", "And yet despite Cha Ling and Hsu Fu Chi\u2019s success and the long history of heritage and craft traditions\u00a0in China, few domestic brands replicated the Western heritage model. Given the fact that heritage commodification implies a certain pride in one\u2019s national, historic, and cultural values, and China has just recently revived nationalism and patriotic education, we should expect more national brands to follow suit in the upcoming year. Ultimately, heritage marketing will aid domestic brands in their efforts to outperform international players in China."]}, {"title": "How to Make Young Chinese Fall in Love with Your Luxury Brand", "meta": "August 26, 2019", "paragraphs": ["When I do luxury leadership seminars for luxury brands, I usually ask participants to answer the questions: What is your favorite luxury brand and what makes this brand particularly luxurious? The answers often differ by age and country, but in recent workshops in China and Japan, I found the following descriptions from young Chinese participants particularly intriguing. They indicate important new dimensions for luxury, and they provide important action areas for brands so they can avoid becoming obsolete in this fast-paced market.", "Luxury is love", "One female seminar participant started talking about her cherished Herm\u00e8s bag. She told me that she usually does not spend a lot of money on products, but that this bag was different \u2014 it wasn\u2019t just a bag. She described the purchase as \u201cfalling in love,\u201d and that she couldn\u2019t help but buy the bag.", "This is one of the most powerful insights about luxury. When luxury is love, brands enter into a love relationship with their customers. Luxury can become very much like a romantic relationship, and it\u2019s up to brands to nurture, strengthen, and maintain that relationship. If it becomes routine, the relationship can easily cool off, and the customer will move on to another brand. Even worse, if customers feel they were cheated, they won\u2019t leave silently. Instead, their love will turn to hate. They will break things off, often publicly, and will tell all their friends about their broken love.", "To avoid this, companies should conduct customer journey audits and rigorously identify what can go wrong and where. Only then can a brand take care of customer-related issues as they come up. By not taking care, they provoke a hard exit, and even being slow to respond gives the customer the impression that they\u2019re not important, which compounds an issue. Excellent service can actually strengthen a customer bond, but failing to offer service can spell disaster in the end.", "Luxury is the ability to influence, innovate, and inspire", "One seminar participant mentioned Gucci, saying that the reason she finds the brand intriguing is its ability to \u201cinfluence, innovate, and inspire.\u201d She saw the brand as disruptive, surprising, and very energetic. She also felt that Gucci was like \u201chome\u201d for her, as the brand is for people who are young and rebellious.", "Luxury should never be boring. Pietro Beccari, the CEO of Dior, once said that luxury is \u201cpure emotion.\u201d This is a great way of stating that luxury brands need to be able to stimulate change. When consumers see a brand doing this, they are drawn to its authenticity and energy. This explains, in part, why Gucci and Dior are among the most successful luxury brands among Millennials and Gen Zers, despite their long histories.", "Always remember that luxury is there to provide unique experiences. Unique means that it cannot be repeated. Therefore, being seen as innovative and influential is of the utmost importance to a luxury brand. The perpetual management of surprise is an essential task for connecting with young consumers. Therefore, when brands play it safe, it quickly becomes the kiss of death.", "Luxury lets you reconnect and recharge", "Well-being is one of the most underestimated aspects of luxury. When people buy luxuries, they\u2019re also buying an escape from the routine of day-to-day life. It allows them to disconnect from their problems and reconnect with their true selves. Because of this, luxury \u2018experiences\u2019 are of utmost importance. Luxury is an end-to-end experience, and the task of luxury brands is to make people feel good and encounter something they could never find anywhere else. In its ultimate form, luxury offers this with the highest possible degree of personalization and individualization.", "Luxury brands need to have a brand-distinct experience strategy, and their branded experience needs to be delivered rigorously and consistently with each customer interaction. This is where most brands fail. Most traditional luxury brands provide comparable experiences. In other words, if you take out the logo, you won\u2019t know which store you\u2019re in. The same goes for luxury hotels. Most of them are the same. From check-in to check-out, the experience is predictable and interchangeable, and when this happens, the experience will not be memorable, special, or luxurious. Luxury brands need to provide a reason for consumers to come and visit. Providing nice architecture or a beautifully designed store isn\u2019t enough. Those things are expected in luxury, but they aren\u2019t the differentiators.", "To differentiate, brands must be clear about who they are. This sounds banal, but it isn\u2019t. The CEO of a U.S.-based luxury fashion brand told me some months ago that what makes them special is that they sell \u201cdreams and experiences.\u201d But, in reality, all luxury brands do that. A brand needs to be specific about which dream it sells and which experience. It needs to be defined in every marketing detail, it has to be actionable for every staff member, and surely it has to do something different than what any other brand is doing. And, most importantly, when there is an identity mismatch, customers are indicating that the brand experience isn\u2019t projecting correctly and needs to be fixed.", "The time for complacency is over", "The Chinese luxury market has recently grown by 20% despite many insisting it no longer had any growth potential. Meanwhile, the expectations of the county\u2019s youngest customers are higher than ever. They interact with brands both digitally and in stores. This requires a dramatically new way of thinking. The best practice five years ago means nothing today. Real-time, data-driven, consumer insight tools that support a rigorous strategy execution are crucial.", "But one aspect that\u2019s often neglected is people. All it takes is one negative touchpoint to damage a customer\u2019s relationship with a brand. That\u2019s why training people is critical. And yet, few brands excel here. It\u2019s not enough to provide a brand manual or do occasional training. Proper luxury training must include fundamental insights about luxury and make clear what the role of each individual is in providing the branded luxury experience. Every musician in an orchestra needs to know their precise role and how and when to contribute. Only then, with repeated training, can an opera be enjoyed.", "When all these conditions are met, a customer can truly fall in love with your luxury brand (just don\u2019t give them a reason to break up with you).", "Daniel Langer is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm \u00c9quit\u00e9.

Afterward, the brand should understand the precise consumer sentiment about itself, and, more importantly, the changes in that sentiment over time. This analysis goes beyond simple social media listening because it gathers data across several brand touchpoints (from store foot traffic to online sales) to create a model of how changes in sentiment impact purchase patterns. Only then can a brand identify the real reasons for its negative performance, which could be anything from weak brand positioning to inefficient communication campaigns. Only then can a company develop precise strategies to strengthen its brand and its performance while also identifying significant marketing savings and efficiency gains.", "China is one of the most attractive markets for luxury brands today, but it is also one of the most challenging.

And this is particularly true when speaking of customers buying luxury bags.\u201d It\u2019s clear that individuality and self-expression are important for younger demographics, and Chinese millennials and Gen-Zers glorify luxury brands that respect their individuality and respond to their peculiar needs. Since the primary in-demand quality of a heritage brand is \u2018exclusivity,\u2019 most luxury buyers have become less enthusiastic about mass production. Consequently, younger consumers want to be involved in the design process by leaving their mark on the end product.", "A 2015 research paper from Deloitte named \u201cThe Deloitte Consumer Review.

Some retail experts argue that in times of recession, trendsetters embrace conspicuous consumption and more restrained aesthetics, while conversely, during a phase of economic expansion, consumers welcome splashy extravagance. Not surprisingly, in China \u2014 a country where the economy is booming and young consumers consider themselves brands \u2014 the customization trend is in high demand. China\u2019s millennial and Gen-Z luxury consumers interpret personalization as a resource that helps them fulfill their right to self-expression and unabashed individualism.", "Longchamp was one brand that was at the forefront of this current customization trend.

This process of creating alongside the designer strengthens the bond between them both, but it\u2019s impossible for many luxury brands to offer a truly bespoke experience. Fortunately, a connection with the audience can be constructed through monogramming or new personalization processes.", "Louis Vuitton\u2019s Hot Stamping program, for instance, lets buyers hot stamp their monograms on small leather products. This process is available in select Louis Vuitton flagship stores, comes complimentary, and is quick (requiring just a few minutes of the buyer\u2019s time). Consequently, an exclusive item produced at a large scale can still become exclusive to the consumer through a personalization process \u2014 one that\u2019s faster and more cost-effective than a bespoke design.", "\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for unique pieces,\u201d according to Sophie Delafontaine, and that\u2019s why Longchamp is focusing more and more on personalization. And now that mass customization is easier to carry out, younger consumers can fully embrace their favorite brands by making each luxury product exclusive to them. This will put pressure on many brands to revise their creative strategies and the technologies they use for them.", "Not long ago, personalization was a costly experience that required the support of craftsmen and artisans, but because of technological developments, consumers can now customize their products quickly and cheaply. This, of course, is not the same as a full bespoke experience but implies something more straightforward like hand-painted monograms on leather accessories (Goyard, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta), embroideries (ABCDior lets consumers embroider their initials on totes and sneakers), and hot stamping services (Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Valentino).", "Considering China\u2019s rich artisan heritage, it\u2019s very likely that luxury consumers will move further away from the prevailing mass-produced premium brands and will instead embrace timeless products developed with skilled artisans.

Zhang Chen, a 22-year-old male Chinese consumer told Jing Daily that he has started to notice the change at Burberry since last year when the brand set up a monogram-stripped giant Thomas Burberry Bear on the Xintiandi Taiping Lake in Shanghai. \u201cThat [installation] left a deep impression on me, which made me feel curious about this old brand, which I thought was for my parents\u2019 generation,\u201d he said. Today, Zhang owns a \u201cThomas Burberry Monogram\u201d t-shirt (priced at $400), which happened to be the first item Tisci designed for the brand. He said he is also considering buying the brand\u2019s \u201cMonogram Strip E-canvas\u201d bum bag (priced at $690), which he felt was \u201ckind of cool.\u201d", "The importance of Burberry\u2019s handbag and accessory category is also rising, which is very important for a luxury brand to win in the Chinese market, as consumers are very into \u201cIt\u201d bags. Burberry\u2019s TB handbag collection is gaining an increasing amount of attention from shoppers lately, according to Rita He, a veteran daigou agent who specializes in serving the country\u2019s upper-middle-class buyers. \u201cThe runway TB bags are in demand by my clients, for example, and lately, the canvas tote bags are also popular,\u201d He said. However, He was uncertain if TB bags could be considered as \u201cIt\u201d bags, \u201cbecause its desirability is still way behind some trending models including Louis Vuitton\u2019s trunk bag, Chanel\u2019s Gabrielle cross-body bag, and Dior\u2019s saddle bag.\u201d", "Aside from product innovation, Burberry also devotes a significant amount of resources to communicate its transformation. In China, the brand is experimenting with the \u201cdrop\u201d retail model on WeChat \u2014 learning from the commercial success of streetwear brands such as Supreme \u2014 to stir excitement and desirability.

The pick-up of Q1 LFL sales did not give the brand enough confidence to lift its full-year projections.

Strategic digital storytelling", "According to McKinsey, almost 80 percent of luxury sales are influenced by online, thus the importance for luxury brands to look at their digital strategy from a different angle, prioritizing innovative distribution channels. Furthermore, classic storytelling techniques need to be modernized so that brands can communicate their message through various agents. As luxury purchases are driven by pleasure and excitement \u2014 and not logic \u2014 the digital realm will design content that instantly captivates the audience.", "Thanks to ingenious communication channels such as Douyin, WeChat, and Weibo, brands can immediately broadcast their message, reaching the consumer through stories, Mini Programs, and live-streaming features, all popular formats to reach a younger consumer base.", "2. A shift to the human side of digital disruption", "Most luxury brands are trying to keep up with the tech-savvy, young consumers but this hunt for implementing the newest technologies and using advanced communication platforms has created an ecosystem where the human aspect is neglected. Most luxury employees only have a basic understanding of technology, leaving this aspect in the hands of a few highly skilled workers. This talent scarcity creates a concerning scenario where coding experts and developers have the power to translate the essence of a brand into a computer code. The shortage of employees with software development skills, social media, and analytics knowledge, and creative digital re-design skills will become a persistent issue. The importance for luxury brands to invest in employee development, creating a generation of workers who understand the digital side but are also sensible to sales and marketing strategy.", "3. Influencer marketing", "The luxury industry is changing beneath our feet, but the perception of influencer marketing remains positive.", "According to a report by Influencer Marketing Hub, Google searches for Influencer marketing grew 1,500 percent from 2016 to today. Furthermore, the industry has experienced robust growth from $1.7 billion in 2016 to $4.6 billion in 2018. In a world that craves authenticity, KOLs are a dynamic marketing and communication tool because they engage directly with their followers. This one-to-one communication appears more honest and dependable than traditional advertising campaigns. Research shows that peer-to-peer marketing is seen by consumers as more trustworthy and genuine than celebrity endorsements. As many of the influencers often have a large audience and high engagement rate, brands can tap the KOL resource to communicate with users and come up with curated offers that respects the needs and wants of the consumer base.", "4. Personalization", "According to McKinsey, Chinese consumers are becoming \u201cmore global, more demanding\u201d and this implies that the one-size-fits-all approach to reach them doesn\u2019t work anymore. Personalization responds to the desire for individualism and authenticity. And younger consumers especially like unique, custom made products. Heritage brands like Louis Vuitton, Goyard, and Dior (with the Oblique line) have come up with product personalization tools that don\u2019t contaminate the brand\u2019s DNA. These luxury houses let buyers express their personality through monogramming, customized embroidery services, hot stamping, and appliques. We expect this trend to have a fundamental impact on luxury consumption even in 2020.", "5. Data is king", "In 2020 premium brands will go beyond statistics and demographics, offering personalized content based on behavioral data. We will witness how brands will create experience-driven content marketing through customer data integration. Furthermore, luxury brands will take further steps to understand and analyze unstructured data coming from social media, weblogs, and emails, while creating marketing strategies that leverage the power of both structured and unstructured data.", "It\u2019s safe to say that even in 2020 data analytics will continue to optimize the customer\u2019s experiences and deliver personalization at a larger scale.", "6. User-generated content", "Authenticity has become a buzz word in luxury marketing, but the overuse of the term hasn\u2019t brought a full-blown embracement of the concept. Foremost, authenticity needs to become the commanding standard when creating content, but all too often luxury brands struggle to do this correctly. The legitimacy issue can be solved by emboldening the dialogue with consumers and co-creating a system that prioritizes customer advocacy. New advancements in technology and communication have empowered the audience, transforming the public into a storyteller, and user-generated content has become a successful way to reach new luxury buyers and drive loyalty.", "7. Identity- based consumer behavior", "In this globalized world, building on the concept of local identity and sustaining local communities is a method that generates healthy growth. On the other hand, a consonant approach that doesn\u2019t respect cultural differences will have negative side effects for the brand\u2019s reputation. Think about Western beauty companies that use white female models to promote their products and imagine the consumer\u2019s lackluster response.

In February, the French fashion house launched a WeChat Mini Program to host a pop-up shop for an exclusive sneaker collection designed by streetwear icon Virgil Abloh.", "Meanwhile, Burberry, which ranked number nine on Gartner L2\u2019s list, was also recognized for its efforts to appeal to young, mobile-first Chinese consumers via their monthly digital \u201cB Series\u201d streetwear drops. Burberry started down this path back in September of last year after welcoming its new creative director, Riccardo Tisci, and generated buzz over the summer months as one of the first big brands to adopt this model. The British fashion brand uses a WeChat Mini Program to release its limited-edition products (they launch on Instagram in the West), and the label fuels anticipation among its Chinese followers by using a countdown clock and push notifications.", "While Louis Vuitton and Burberry were the only brands on Gartner L2\u2019s top ten list that adopted drop retail in the past year, they weren\u2019t the only brands in the industry that opted for its appeal. In January of this year, Balenciaga posted a pink monogram Logo Ville bag for sale on its WeChat Mini Program with few details aside from a link to its e-commerce page. Long before this, LVMH\u2019s Rimowa caught the attention of Chinese streetwear lovers with its luggage collaboration with Supreme, which generated buzz on Chinese social media despite the fact that the products were not available to purchase anywhere in the country.", "There are signs that this model could be here to stay, at least as long as streetwear culture thrives among young shoppers in China. For now, things look promising, according to Gartner L2\u2019s Luxury China Digital IQ Index 2019 data. It shows that streetwear terms saw a strong 12-percent, year-over-year Baidu Index growth during a one-year period ending in March 2019 (compared to only a 5-percent growth for traditional fashion terms).", "\u201cEmbracing streetwear and sneakers is a way to stay relevant with the millennial and Gen Z shoppers that are crucial to luxury brands\u2019 future,\u201d said Liz Flora, the editor of Asia Pacific Research at Gartner L2. \u201cFashion brands\u2019 evolution to meet the next generation\u2019s tastes needs to involve an understanding of not only new fashion trends, but also how this younger generation utilizes digital platforms to gather information and shop.\u201d", "In China, WeChat Mini Programs are today\u2019s popular way to execute flash sales, but they\u2019re not the only way digital drop retail models are conducted. Moncler turned to Tmall for their limited-time pre-sale of six Moncler Genius collections (with one containing items that were exclusive to the e-commerce platform). Meanwhile, Fendi did a limited pop-up of its FF Reloaded capsule collection on JD.com\u2019s Toplife in tandem with the release of K-pop star Jackson Wang\u2019s hit single Fendiman.", "Flora notes that in the luxury industry, online is generally a safer avenue than offline for brands that want to try out the drop model, \u201cespecially when it comes to items with a high resale value that can spark a buying frenzy among third-party sellers, including China\u2019s daigou agents. Balenciaga learned this the hard way last year when a Chinese daigou agent was involved in a brawl at its Paris store over the Triple S sneaker launch.\u201d (It is worth noting that LV\u2019s sneaker collection was, in fact, available at two physical locations.)", "While the \u201cdrop\u201d is undoubtedly a buzzword for 2019, various versions of this sales model had already been successfully utilized in luxury retail in China. \u201cInstead of a \u2018drop\u2019 where the items are more of a surprise, luxury brands often utilize fashion influencers and celebrities to drive hype online ahead of time and sell out within minutes,\u201d Flora said. Case in point: Mr. Bags worked with Givenchy to promote a limited-edition Mini Horizon bag for $2,173 (15,000 RMB) that sold out in 12 minutes and garnered a lot of attention for the brand.", "Of course, it\u2019s difficult to predict whether more brands adopting this sales tactic on China\u2019s social media platforms will dilute that sought-after allure of exclusivity. But Supreme enthusiasts seem enthralled by more than just the buildup and the hard-to-get mentality \u2014 they are also lured in by the brand\u2019s culture. For Burberry, too, it seems that consumers are drawn in by the storytelling around each of Tisci\u2019s handpicked products. Ultimately, this just adds to the potential engagement and marketing pull for the brand, which should be a bigger priority than total sales.", "However, large luxury brands following the Supreme model are doing so \u201cas it fits into the corporate planning and approval procedures that are needed in that type of business environment,\u201d said Richard Hobbs, co-founder of retail consultancy firm Entrepot Asia. \u201cThis does mean that the actual product or collection concept has often been gestating for many months, and often up to a year until the consumer gets their hands on it. The younger, and inevitably more interesting, brands that are appearing are able to move from idea to consumer in a matter of weeks.\u201d", "Brands might also gain an edge by embarking on localized, relevant collaborations. \u201cIf you are trying to attract a drop friendly audience then it also helps if you are working with designers, brands, or celebrities that resonate with that culture,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cIf the luxury players can deal with the various issues around sign-offs, supply chain, and distribution, this should be a focus, in my opinion.\u201d"]}, {"title": "What China\u2019s Retail Expansion and Disruption Means for Luxury Brands", "meta": "July 4, 2019", "paragraphs": ["These days, retail growth in China is occurring online and on mobile.

According to Pierre Xiao Lu, the civil servants in ancient China had an appetite for the finer things: enjoying cultural activities and elevated hobbies that exalted their artisanal skills. Craftsmanship and artistry were widely associated with the upper class.", "During the following centuries, China experienced various political and socio-economic changes via imperial dynasties, destructive wars, and eventually, Mao\u2019s Communism.

While Western societies are largely individualistic, usually emphasizing the need for distinctiveness, China is ruled by collectivism. As a result, it has become a society where individuals respect social norms and aspire to achieve conformity while being assimilated into strong, cohesive social groups. Therefore, in China, luxury goods are more than the peripheral status symbols they are in the West; they\u2019ve become badges of success. For affluent buyers, the fastest and easiest way to convey their role as a winner in society is through luxury consumption.", "However, the younger generations don\u2019t play by the same rules.

To many Chinese arcade-game lovers, these arcade-shopping installations resemble a less risky form of gambling. Xuanxuan Liu, a 25-year-old graphic designer in Shenzhen, tells Jing Daily that these arcade games are a way of relief to her work life. \u201cI often stop by the lipstick claw machine after working late night in the office. It is like gambling, but you end up winning makeup instead of money,\u201d she said.", "Besides the psychic thrill, social media amplifies the Chinese millennials\u2019 fixation on arcade games. Camilla Qiu, a 22-year-old fashion design student in London, said, \u201cI first got fascinated by these arcade shopping games by looking at Douyin (China\u2019s viral video-sharing app) because it was a huge trend.

Tackling this new world implies conquering the full essence of the digital customer experience and embracing growing trends like peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms.", "Wardrobe sharing apps are the latest global hype, perfectly responding to the needs of the environmentally conscious, hyper-connected consumers. Replacing ownership with convenience and accessibility is not something invented by millennials but they are responsible for significant advancements in the market. Despite a robust appetite for P2P apps, some critics voiced concerns regarding the long-term impact on the luxury market.", "First, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the sharing economy is seeing robust growth. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report from 2015 predicts that global revenues from the sharing economy will generate $335 billion by 2025. In China, the sharing economy has seen dramatic growth and World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025 it will account for 20% of the GDP. Furthermore, according to a 2017 report from iResearch China, the country already recorded 12 unicorns, overtaking the lead from the U.S. who registered only 11 unicorns. In China, the sharing economy was strongly supported by the ruling Communist Party; thus, the boom was powered by competing public strategies and favorable policies.", "Second, the sharing economy revolutionizes sustainability by reducing waste, greenhouse gas emission, and toxic substances.

Owning a Birkin means paying a premium but renting it comes with a lower price tag. Despite its disruptive essence, the sharing model has the potential to harm the luxury sector. Consumers need to take in consideration the following developments:", "1. The sharing economy is sabotaging craftsmanship and the artisan-made production", "The blueprint of a luxury product demands effort, exceptional skills, and several hundreds of hours of labor. Heritage brands like Chanel and Dior partner with ateliers and distinguished craftsmen to create the latest designs. During his time at Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld was praised for perpetuating centuries-old craftsmanship\u00a0through collaborations with Lesage, Desrues, Lemari\u00e9, and Maison Michel. As expected, a design that requires several hundreds of hours of labor is close to an art piece and this increases the value of the product. But in the shared economy, these garments pass from buyer to buyer, losing their uniqueness and appeal. High-end apparel was not intended to become conventional but aspirational and rare. The scarcity of the designs pushed the market price up, but if the garments are available to a wider public, the price falls again. In the long run, democratizing the high-end fashion world will put out of business various ateliers and craftsmen.", "2. Quality issues", "Loose stitching, lost buttons, broken zippers, and faded colors. Everyone who ever owned a piece of clothing knows that even investment pieces wear out.

Mandy Velez from the Daily Beast\u00a0details in a long post her USPS misstep, which came with a lofty financial penalty.", "3. Consumers associate luxury with ownership, not with access", "It\u2019s difficult to preserve the brand\u2019s luxury identity if the product is available for mass consumption. In the long run, the accessibility offered by the sharing economy dilutes the identity of luxury brands making them bleed market share. Exclusivity means keeping the masses out not inviting them in.", "4.

As the world moves faster, the retail market tries to keep the pace. Medium estimates that 15 years ago, Chinese consumers wore approximately 200 times a garment before disposing it. Today, the number has decreased to 62 wears. Fast-fashion brands, and not heritage houses, are to be blamed for conspicuous consumption. So, wardrobe-sharing platforms are a greener alternative to luxury buying, but they still don\u2019t solve the problem in the long run.", "5. The death of shopping gratification", "Not only ownership but also instant shopping gratification gets eliminated in the sharing economy. As consumers stop buying new garments, they cease to enjoy the emotional hype that comes with new purchases. Curbing instant gratification and emotional purchases is morally virtuous but eliminating it altogether means cutting production and retail jobs, bankrupting companies, and sending the retail market into a death spiral.", "6. Risk of counterfeit luxury goods", "\u00a0The vast majority of wardrobe sharing platforms has to overcome additional hiring challenges, as they can\u2019t access experts who have competence in counterfeit products.

In the age of overexposure, the beauty market is dependent on customer testimonials from vloggers and influencers.

For example, I didn\u2019t want to expose Asian cultures in my collection, and that\u2019s a sign of not being confident enough [about our culture].\u201d Wang also spoke about how she began appreciating Asian aesthetics again after working as a stylist for Chinese actor-director Jiang Wen\u2019s film Hidden Man.", "Oriental style is more than just bamboo", "Another presenter, the Chinese-American designer Juju Wang, first became known for her creative involvement on the Herm\u00e8s Home line and has since collaborated with big names like YSL, Dior, Givenchy, and Swarovski.

While the majority of brands entering China have a steep learning curve, nearly every brand is not maximizing their potential in the market today. Here are five reasons why brands are leaving good money on the table when it comes to millennials:", "1. Underestimating Chinese consumers", "Chinese millennial consumers are highly educated, and their familiarity with digital tools makes them highly empowered. Despite that, brands do little \u2014 or the wrong type of \u2014 market research. Traditional market research is a waste of money in China because surveys focus on too few cities, don\u2019t reach enough consumers, and their results are too slow. In the fast-changing world of Chinese millennial consumers, studies that were taken even two months ago might already be useless or misleading. Only real-time consumer measurements of AI-powered social media listening techniques can steer brands accurately in China. Chinese social media networks are firewalled and challenging to analyze, but with the right expertise and machine learning, brands can correctly observe or analyze data on their consumers, brand, competition, and more.", "2. Using the wrong communication content", "Many brands fail because they convince themselves that the content produced for the rest of the world will also be relevant in China. Aside from the content itself, brands must know the delivery systems. Many underestimate the importance of Chinese key opinion leaders (KOL) and influencers, given that they help brands successfully engage with potential customers on local social media platforms like WeChat. Meanwhile, companies waste millions of dollars with \u201cclassic\u201d advertising in China instead of fully embracing digital methods that produce a measurable ROI. Creating the wrong type of content not only wastes money on bad methods, but brands can\u2019t even measure whether or not that marketing has lead to any significant sales.", "3. Underestimating the power of brands in China", "Chinese consumers love brands because they identify with them. That\u2019s why brand storytelling is much more important in China than in any other place in the world. Yet despite this, most brands do not create an end-to-end brand experience for Chinese consumers. With few exceptions, they focus on selling and not on creating an experience across all touch points. That requires a thorough brand audit, a positioning exercise, and a customer journey assessment. Without perfect brand storytelling at each interaction point, luxury brands will lose the Chinese consumer, without exception. It\u2019s surprising that luxury brands aren\u2019t rigorous about experience creation. Chinese millennials are more discerning in China than in other countries, yet they are not serviced better.", "4. Not being digital enough", "Some brands have a CRM (customer relationship management) system, but it\u2019s handled by customer service, while others have a CRM online, but one that isn\u2019t at all related to store visits. In other words, many brands do not use their most valuable asset: data about their consumers. And by not using their data, they are not servicing their consumers sufficiently. Therefore, by not being digital enough, they create inferior consumer experiences. This is positively the kiss of death in China. Everything MUST be digital there. In all cases, a digital infrastructure must be designed and deployed that connects all data \u2014 including sales data \u2014 and uses advanced data querying methods to create highly personalized experiences that feel luxurious.

There is no free lunch", "Launching in China without a budget and just hoping you\u2019ll attract hundreds of millions of millennials in China is a guarantee for failure. Weak brands in China with bad economics, unprofitable store locations, and expensive overhead costs will infinitely weaken a brand, and in such scenarios, the brand\u2019s best talent will quit, further accelerating its downfall. Investing in the perfect launch, after thorough brand and strategy development, is absolutely necessary. For many luxury companies, China has become their biggest headache and correcting mistakes winds up being much more expensive than if they\u2019d done it right from the beginning.", "In short, brands need to rethink their approach when it comes to understanding China and its millennial consumers. They need to become consumer-centric, meaning that they must create relevant content and build a strong brand identity. That requires a strong story and a rigorous customer journey design. They also need to become digital: If they think they are already digital, then they need to become even more digital. And they definitely can\u2019t launch in China without investing first.

Consumers get most of their information about brands from Chinese social platforms like WeChat, and the nature of those platforms makes it more likely that consumers in China will connect with influencer content than in other countries in which websites and reviews play more prominent roles.

They\u2019ve grown comfortable with receiving guidance from influencers they follow, even if they know that all of the most relevant KOLs have highly paid contracts with large international brands like Christian Dior, Est\u00e9e Lauder, or Gucci, to name a few. It\u2019s all about emulating the lifestyle of their idols, following their advice, and becoming part of their communities.", "Third, many Chinese consumers are still relatively new to the luxury market. They\u2019re looking for guidance and typically trust KOLs more than the information they receive directly from brands.", "To recap, influencers give consumers direction, inspiration, and curation. They help them to navigate through the quickly changing luxury market \u2014 to know which items are \u201chot,\u201d which sneakers are coolest, or which bag or jacket is best. A KOL\u2019s influence goes far beyond the celebrity endorsements that western brands like Rolex or Aston Martin have used over the decades in Western markets. By following a KOL, consumers receive all types of appropriate advice, such as how to dress in a specific situation or which hotel is best to stay in on a specific vacation. While Western celebrity endorsements seem to simply connect their image to a brand, KOLs bring brands into particular and personal contexts. That is their greatest power in influencing Chinese consumers.", "How then, you may ask, should luxury brands select the right influencer? The most important aspect is how a brand\u2019s equity and market positioning fits with the influencer\u2019s image. This sounds logical, but I\u2019m surprised at how few brands have systems in place to help them make these selections in a precise, risk-averse way. The first step is understanding how Chinese consumers see the brand, which in turn requires brand audits combined with advanced consumer listening capabilities that dig deeper than the relatively closed-off Chinese social media networks. Similarly, this exercise should be done with a group of potential influencers to learn who is following them, how they are seen, and which conversations they\u2019re connected to. In the end, the brand has to match the influencer.", "Once a match is found, the right content strategy needs to be developed. Then the brand should use AI-based data analytics to measure exactly how the influencer campaign is resonating with consumers by tracking actual sales back to the influencer. An integrated data ecosystem ultimately lets the brand evaluate if it has chosen the right influencer or created the right communication content.", "Given the importance of KOLs in China, it\u2019s surprising that companies rely more on gut feeling when selecting influencers and content rather than data-driven decision-making. KOLs aren\u2019t just \u201cnice to have\u201d in China \u2014 they\u2019re one of the most important marketing tools in the country today, and as such, they need to be managed much more precisely than most brands realize.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm\u00c9quit\u00e9.

The platform just cleaned its site of micro-influencers recently, meaning that anyone who has less than 5,000 followers and averages less than 10,000 views per post can no longer form partnerships with brands. While this should be good for the overall health and quality of the platform\u2019s ecosystem, it could be bad for the latecomers to influencer marketing on the platform. \u201cThe new rules are going to make influencer marketing more expensive,\u201d argues Lauren Hallanan, a Chinese social media marketing expert. \u201cThey\u2019re restricting the number of influencers that can do sponsored posts, as well as the amount of sponsored posts they can do, so they are decreasing supply which means the price will rise.\u201d", "The regulations signal that Red is preparing for bigger brands \u2014 a move that will hopefully devote more advertising money to the site and make Red a more fully-developed e-commerce system in the future. The opportunity for luxury brands (for now) seem to be more related to exposure rather than sales. Since Red is so content-driven, users get most of their tips about a product they have interest in, but then they get off the site to search for the best platform to buy that item from online. This has made it somewhat difficult for Red to convert sales on its platform.

In other cases, brands can also use the chatbox to fulfill this goal (see below).", "", "Once this information has been collected, brands can send tailored messages by gender, location, and even their relationship status. For example, the German fashion brand MCM utilized the power of sCRM for their pop-up shop in China.

The country\u2019s rising upper-middle-class households, according to the report, is the backbone of the growth, stating that 350 million people in China will earn between $2,600 and $3,900 per month per household by 2025.", "", "With a slew of luxury brands from LVMH to Kering to Herm\u00e8s delivering their latest earnings results in recent weeks, there\u2019s a growing concern that luxury in China has become a winner-takes-all market. \u201cYou see strong brands getting stronger, and not-so-strong brands getting weaker,\u201d said Daniel Zipser, Senior Partner of McKinsey, as well as one of the major authors of the report. \u201c[But] I do think there is an opportunity for brands that are not as big and as strong in the China market to turn around and to accelerate their growth.

It is equally important for brands to understand how this finding is going to shape and affect their overarching strategies from product design, retail, to marketing and branding.", "Chinese consumers are trend-driven", "Chinese consumers\u2019 heavy reliance on digital media to receive information on luxury and fashion makes their shopping decisions trend-driven. \u201cThese new luxury consumers are influenced more by what is happening right now, leaving ample room for brands with the right strategy to shape their tastes,\u201d the report stated.", "", "This explains why \u201cIT\u201d bags, shoes, and clothes abound in the Chinese market. A great number of customers, who are not as sophisticated and discerning as the Western counterparts, are hugely influenced by what celebrities, fashion key opinion leaders (KOLs), and brands say and recommend via social media. An example used by McKinsey to illustrate this point is how Chanel promoted its Gabrielle bag in China. The brand first hired Yang Mi, one of China\u2019s top actresses (and who represented brands including Estee Lauder, Michael Kors, and Stuart Weitzman), to pose for the campaign, which stirred widespread public interest and then collaborated with KOLs like Mr. Bags to push the campaign message to its targeted audience.", "Luxury shopping activities bring social capital", "The underlying social nature of luxury shopping is particularly important to Chinese shoppers, the report said. Young Chinese consumers view ownership and affiliation with designer brands as a form of social capital; not just something to wear \u2014 but a lifestyle choice that marks them as part of a distinct and exclusive community. McKinsey also noted nearly 70 percent of post-90s consumers, who they surveyed, said purchasing luxury goods was a way to make them feel distinct from others.", "The overwhelmingly social nature of luxury consumption in China also made consumers become more aware and appreciative for craftsmanship, the report said.

Therefore, it\u2019s become crucial for luxury brands to provide customers with the right service at the right moment. Artificial intelligence (AI), which uses the latest technologies to learn from buyer experiences, offers them the best solutions.", "In our conversation with Daniel Langer, CEO of the luxury and lifestyle brand development company \u00c9quit\u00e9, Jing Daily attempts to discover what exactly AI means to the luxury industry today, what obstacles are keeping some brands from fully embracing this technology, and if there are any foreseeable consequences in applying AI to the luxury business.", "Daniel Langer, CEO of \u00c9quit\u00e9.

Just about ten years ago, most luxury CEOs I talked to told me that there would be no luxury brand selling online ever. Those CEOs either retired or were fired for a good reason. Now, digitization is on top of the luxury industry\u2019s agenda. Hence we see brands that are much more open today, with some players like Gucci, Dior, Chanel, and even Rolls-Royce shifting an enormous focus to digital. Advanced data querying, machine learning, and AI require much more competency than many in-house teams have. Few companies in the world truly master AI, and very few can combine AI with luxury strategies as \u00c9quit\u00e9 does.", "How can AI improve the customer experience?", "First of all, let me clarify that when most people speak about AI, they mean something different. The word is very often overused. \u201cAdvanced data querying\u201d would be more precise in many cases. AI is just a component of it and makes sense in specific cases where complex connections between data points need to be identified. Advanced data analytics can help to document and improve the consumer experience by generating insights and making sure that each customer always receives personalized service. As an example: Imagine that you regularly shop at your local Louis Vuitton store, let\u2019s say in Shanghai. They know you, and the service experience is tailored to you. Then you travel to Hong Kong on a business trip. Ideally, the store staff should know all about your history and preferences, and you should feel at home. What you don\u2019t want is to feel like a stranger just because you are not at your home store or because you access the brand online. All touchpoint experiences need to be connected and seamless. But that\u2019s not yet AI, that would be a holistic CRM [customer relationship management] system.", "On top of that CRM infrastructure, AI can now help you identify complex patterns, predict what you may like, and trigger personalized customer journeys, perhaps through an automated email with specific content based on predictive analytics. Hence, the AI system ideally triggers an interaction precisely at the right moment. The ideal result is a personalized experience that excites consumers across all touch-points with relevant content.", "What are some mistakes luxury brands usually make with AI?", "The biggest mistake is to underestimate how game-changing this technology is. I believe that in the future, brands will either succeed by powering their customer journeys with AI-generated insights and actions or they won\u2019t survive. That\u2019s because competing without it means not generating enough insight, wasting digital advertising money, and using content that isn\u2019t optimized. This is simply not sustainable over time. Brands should run on data, not on gut feeling.", "Can you name one luxury brand that you think is good at utilizing AI?", "The auction house Sotheby\u2019s has impressed me with how they use advanced data technologies like AI to determine, for example, which types of paintings might receive the highest bids. Hence, the application goes far beyond the customer journey. A brand should know if a specific advertising campaign triggers a particular sale. AI can provide that if applied in the right way.", "Luxury is emotional while AI is logical. Will AI change the nature of luxury? ", "AI is an enabler. It allows us to identify the roots of issues, make sense of behavior, and reveal otherwise hidden patterns. This, in turn, helps a brand run in a much more efficient way. Which allows us to be more creative. To me, it is not logic versus emotion.

The crackdown on corruption has certainly impacted imports, illicit or otherwise, making Ma Ke and company more appealing; the recent rumblings of a trade war with the U.S. have underscored those instincts. And China\u2019s demand for luxury, while slower than in recent years, still continues to climb, with one McKinsey report estimating a 121 percent hike in the decade from 2016. There\u2019s one major difference in the maturing Chinese premium market: those new shoppers, who will help it more than double, are from smaller, third-tier cities. Their disposable income, of course, might not stretch as easily to a Louis Vuitton bag, but local luxury counterparts to prestige European brands, though, will be easily within reach.", "The most impactful factor for this shift in spending isn\u2019t political or economic, though. Rather, it\u2019s psychographic, at least according to CSG\u2019s Simon Tye. There\u2019s a marked difference in mindset between the Middle Kingdom\u2019s Generation X and its children, the emerging Generation Z, especially regarding the prestige of Chinese-made premium goods. \u201cThe attitude of 18-24 year olds [towards China] is very different from their parents,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have absolutely no memory of the remnants of Communism, just prosperity and the growth of China.\u201d They don\u2019t see Ma Ke or Guo Pei as a poor substitute for Gucci but rather a worthy rival.", "Indeed, Tye suggests that the rise of homegrown brands is one element in a much larger cultural shift. In the immediate, post-Communist era, new consumers shied away from direct associations with their culture. Compare them with this new generation, which is fiercely proud of anything Chinese. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League proclaimed its first ever Traditional Chinese Garment Day in April 2018, encouraging those same Gen Zers to adopt huafu, or \u201cChinese dress\u201d for the day. It was a marked success. Even in travel, China\u2019s market is looking inwards.

As they experiment with sweeter and more powerful fragrances, it opens the door to the gustatory, or taste and flavor family of scents, so far underrepresented in the Chinese market.

There is no one-size-fits-all style. Different cultures expect different things in different contexts. Sometimes, you have to be a bit directive when you need to bring a change and drive people there. In some other cases, it is more of a consensus-based management style where you pull people and energy together. The first thing as a manager that you should learn is that you have to adjust your style to the role at that time. So contextual management is the key.\u201d", "Hitting out against what he sees as the prevailing management style globally, he quoted Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu.", "\u201cMy general conviction about management is that there are currently two different streams of thinking worldwide, he said. \u201cThe one mostly published in books and reviews is that \u2018only the paranoid survive\u2019. I entirely disagree with this idea. The other one is on the opposite, which is \u2018to be inclusive, to work on the energy, inspiration and motivation\u2019. It can refer to European thinkers of the Renaissance, and Sun Tzu, the author of his Art of War. The representative thinker from the Renaissance is Machiavelli who was a pessimist who believed that only the paranoid survived. But Erasmus was more of a believer in knowledge, in education, and said that wise people will make wise things. In the Art of War, Sun Tzu said, \u2018any war reduces the energy of the world\u2019, so the best is not to go to war, but rather to turn your enemies into your allies, which I think is really true. Do not waste your energy on useless fights.

High jewelry was perceived to be something exclusive, but 2,000 people lined up in the snow to see the beauty. It was an opportunity to share a real sense of beauty. That was culture too and the setting was beautiful.\u201d", "Exhibitions are also a powerful communication tool for the younger generation, said Vigneron.", "\u201cOne of the differences between the generation of today and the past is that, the generation in the past learned things by reading books and magazines, but the current generation wants to learn things right away. An exhibition is good way because they come to experience it right away, to look and feel.\u201d", "Summing up his thoughts on the intersection between art and luxury, Vigneron said, \u201cMany brands are trying to link themselves with culture in various ways, which are good.

Moreover, e-commerce websites like Tmall and Taobao have also stepped into the game as the line between e-tail and entertainment continues to blur.", "2. Who\u2019s watching? ", "It is also important for luxury brands to understand who their livestream viewers are. To drive high social media engagement, a great number of brands choose to work with popular celebrities and influencers for livestream sessions. However, many of a celebrity\u2019s followers may not have the purchasing power to afford a designer handbag or a runway dress. Working with traditional fashion magazines may be better, as their customer base is more in line with luxury consumers.", "3. Is the brand still exclusive? ", "Another crucial concern is whether livestreaming undermines a given brand\u2019s traditional image as exclusive and prestigious. Opening up to the public is anathema to what many luxury businesses built their reputations upon. While livestreaming may help a brand connect with more customers, will it offend established clients who prefer to believe they are part of a more privileged group?

The majority opt for a simple transliteration, choosing a series of characters with sounds that closely mimic the pronunciation of the brand\u2019s original name.

Many of the brands we listed in other categories have at least some presence on WeChat too.", "WeChat can feel more social and intimate, more like a real retail environment. In fact, WeChat has already been put to use in retail stores by sales associates. Many brands\u00a0have devoted energy to developing an integrated online and offline strategy through WeChat.", "But because the primary function of WeChat is still social, it may not be a sustainable revenue stream.

As Pavlovsky mentioned, exclusivity is the definition of luxury, consumers take pride in exclusive items only they can access and exclusive pricing only they are aware of. Going e-commerce could mean many things; it could mean presenting transparent pricing that everyone can gain access to, or buyers missing out on exclusive shopping experiences in store.

Pop-up sales, limited editions, and Valentine\u2019s Day-only are some of the marketing techniques frequently deployed by luxury brands to create exclusivity. While activities on WeChat can be social, transactional, and intimate, it can stimulate an exclusive shopping experience that is closer to a retail environment.

However, the four characters on her dress,\u00a0luse jingji\u00a0(\u7eff\u8272\u7ecf\u6d4e), mean \u201cgreen economy.\u201d Moreover, her dress featured simplified characters, but Chinese calligraphy is almost exclusively written in traditional characters.", "The phrase on Perry\u2019s dress was actually promoted as a key theme in China\u2019s efforts towards an eco-friendly society by the then president Hu Jintao. Having a contemporary political slogan used in a traditional painting style not only appeared odd because modern and classical Chinese are two distinct languages, but it also failed to demonstrate the beauty of the Chinese language. Indeed, as political slogans tend to be concise and effective phrases to communicate policy goals to the wider public, the use of a political slogan on a piece of luxury clothing clashed with the desire of Chinese luxury consumers to communicate a sense of exclusivity and luxury.", "2. Misunderstanding of Chinese Symbols and Imagery\u00a0", "Chinese characters are complicated and often evoke particular elements of Chinese culture. As the western world has developed an interest in Asia-related elements, luxury brands often generalize and oversimplify.", "Givenchy was criticized for the simple mistake they made with their special-edition red-and-gold Chinese New Year star clutch. The Chinese national flag features five gold stars in the top left corner on a red background, and the Vietnamese flag is simply a red flag with a gold star in the middle. The Givenchy clutch appeared to be a tribute to Vietnam, which at the time was witnessing large anti-Chinese demonstrations and riots because of the ongoing dispute over the South China Sea.", "Moreover, even when luxury brands are familiar with the meaning of China-related imagery, they still struggle with utilizing Chinese aesthetic traditions.

As there is no one fixed image for a rooster, luxury brands created their own images of the rooster of a blessing. While Estee Lauder\u2019s powder compact featuring a diamond rooster was considered too dramatic, Dior\u2019s bracelet with a rooster with a round body and big eyes had a childish aesthetic inconsistent with the brand\u2019s overall image. Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s rooster bomber jacket visually bombarded the audience by featuring six roosters on it, and the casualness of the hand-drawn roosters did not quite fit the atmosphere of Chinese New Year.", "However, the failures of luxury brands\u2019 discussed above do not mean Chinese people are necessarily hard to please. Moreover, many times aesthetics are a universal concept. There are definitely good examples of appealing to Chinese consumers by using Chinese imagery by keeping in mind common conventions of aesthetics.", "3. Abusive Use of Bright Colors", "Many Chinese express their dissatisfaction with the monotony of luxury brands\u2019 China-themed designs. Since most of the Chinese special-edition designs were launched to celebrate Chinese New Year, almost all luxury brands favor an intense use of red and gold. However, the overuse of those colors can be associated with a sense of gaudiness.", "Traditional Chinese artwork often uses mild colors contrasted with a white background, like in many paintings, or is simply wholly white and black, like calligraphy. Luxury brands should not be stuck in the mindset of using red and gold as a representation of Chinese culture. A deeper cultural investigation into traditional artistic themes throughout Chinese history could demonstrate a more thought-provoking utilization of Chinese artistic themes, and that effort will surely be appreciated by Chinese luxury consumers.", "Photo: Weibo", "One of the advantages that the Palace Museum has in terms of understanding Chinese aesthetics is its incredibly abundant resources. The collection of this former imperial palace is arguably the best Chinese history collection in the world. Moreover, being the most prestigious history museum in China, the Palace Museum highly values its reputation, and always refers to its own collection for the inspiration of its gift shop products.", "As a result, many of the gifts from the Palace Museum evoke the deep cultural heritage of China. For example, the patterns of the blue & white porcelain tape series are directly taken from those on\u00a0imperial vases. The calligraphy tapes\u00a0also feature the craft of famous Chinese calligraphers.", "The success of the Palace Museum tapes hinges upon design based on cultural references instead of assumptions. Chinese culture being correctly understood and beautifully presented by luxury brands that have international influence matters a lot to Chinese consumers, but brands should also be more aware of the authenticity of \u201cChinese aesthetics.\u201d The fact that the top cultural institution of China emphasizes historical accuracy in its design should be an inspiration for luxury brands."]}, {"title": "5 Things to Know About the Hottest Pop-up Retailing Trend in China", "meta": "November 13, 2017", "paragraphs": ["Pop-up retailing is experiencing explosive growth in China.

Luxury brands\u2019 pop-up stores are using interesting design features to attract attention, a tactic that huge brand names have already experimented with. For example, Dior set up pop-up stores displaying their new women\u2019s line in Shanghai IFC and Beijing SKU right in front of its permanent storefronts this year.", "Unlike in the US and UK, where pop-up stores are often on the street, pop-up stores in China are mostly set up in shopping malls due to strict regulations. For example, the regulations of the Shanghai Municipality on urban road transport clearly state that the government will not grant any applications from companies to operate a business in front of their stores or on either side of the road. Many cities have adopted similar practices, which leaves brands little choice but to set up their pop-up stores in shopping malls.", "Nonetheless, these locations might actually give brands an edge. Shopping malls have a huge amount of foot traffic, attract the right demographics, and offer more convenient setups as amenities are already in place.

For those who are interested in direct sales, China\u2019s laws and regulations require brands to have a corporate presence in China in order to conduct sales directly. That means brands need to have a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise or Foreign Invested Partnership Enterprise in China in order to have a pop-up store to sell products. Brands can also conduct sales through partners, such as distributors or agents.", "However, for those brands who don\u2019t have the right to conduct sales in China, they can still set up a temporary store just for the sake of outreach to Chinese consumers by letting them experience products. If brands can successfully entice consumers with their samples, they can direct consumers to place orders on their websites.", "Having consumers take pictures and share location on WeChat Moments is a must. On the one hand, consumers want to demonstrate online that they have been to cool places. On the other hand, by giving consumers incentives\u2014gifting them or rewarding them complimentary services if they post pictures online\u2014brands will gain more lasting attention.", "Another way to increase exposure and gain traffic is by partnering with celebrities and KOLs. This has been practiced by local brands such as Suning Ecommerce Group and has achieved a great success.", "Many brands are engaging customers with food and beverages. Bobbi Brown and Kenzo have opened pop-up stores that offer coffee. Chanel opened Coco Caf\u00e9 in Shanghai to sell lip glosses this April, but it also provided consumers complimentary coffee and dessert. A report carried out by BFG-blueview shows that food pop-up retailing is the best way for brands to make waves.

After taking it over, she hired the Moroccan Jewish designer Alber Elbaz who had just left Yves Saint Laurent at the time. It turned out to be one of her best decisions.", "Recalling her first meeting with Elbaz, Wang told the Financial Times in a 2012 interview that she hired him because she felt she received respect from Elbaz, unlike other personalities in the fashion industry. Moreover, Elbaz\u2019s work with Yves Saint Laurent appealed to her. Since then, Wang and Elbaz became a pair of powerful partners and developed a very warm relationship.

Women\u2019s Wear Daily reported big luxury retail giants such as Macy\u2019s, Ralph Lauren, and Abercrombie & Fitch are closing a total of 124 stores in the United States, including Ralph Lauren Polo\u2019s Fifth Avenue flagship store. This phenomenon is also apparent in China; last month, a Bernstein report revealed that China has experienced more luxury stores closure than anywhere else in the world from 2016 to 2017, with the most closures coming from Burberry and Dunhill\u2014both time-honored luxury European brands.", "Amid the debate on the wellbeing of brick-and-mortar stores, investment company Exane BNP Paribas conducted an interesting market investigation.

The results paint a compelling picture.", "", "Among the 37 brands, two luxury timepiece brands\u2014Audemars Piguet and Officine Panerai\u2014had the highest store traffic, but the numbers are insignificant: they each had five customers visiting the stores during the one-hour observation period. ", "The brands that followed are: Dior Cosmetics and Rolex, each with four visitors, and Ermenegildo Zegna and Kenzo, each with three visitors. Well-known luxury brands such as Givenchy, Gucci, Celine, and Tory Burch had zero visitors.", "The observation did not acknowledge whether the customers made any purchases. In addition, the observation was not intended to be a strict marketing survey, rather merely an experiment to compare store traffic across the various luxury brands, according to Luca Solca, Head of Luxury Goods Department at Exane BNP Paribas. ", "Regardless, a great number of people might find the results surprising no matter which side of the argument they are on. Given that Hong Kong IFC Mall is located at one of the city\u2019s busiest transit junctions\u2014it is interconnected to two major subway stations, Hong Kong, and Central, both of which are accessible from inside the shopping compound and have a daily flow of 2,500,000 commuters\u2014geographically, IFC Mall should receive nearly the same amount of commuter traffic as the subway stations. The mall is at the heart of Hong Kong\u2019s financial center, where the city\u2019s most wealthy people work. ", "The interpretation of the transect is open-ended; but it\u2019s worth taking a deeper look. Since the observation was conducted on a Monday during rush hour, one interpretation is that if the stores see this few visitors during the busiest time of the day, they will surely not see more visitors at other times. Another interpretation is just the opposite: the reason these stores have so little traffic is that rush hour is when people are rushing home from a full day of work and have no interest in stopping to shop. ", "\u201cIt is tough to generalise from these observations,\u201d said Solca. \u201cThe idea is to provide real-life data points, comparing traffic across different stores, no matter the time.\u201d ", "Like Solca said, no definitive conclusion can be drawn without a more controlled survey. One thing is for sure, however, that political tension and government policies play a major role in Hong Kong\u2019s luxury market, especially for physical retail stores.", "In the aftermath of Occupy Central Movement in Hong Kong in 2014, the Chinese government issued an update on the entry permit policy in 2015. More restrictions were put on Mainland citizen\u2019s ability to obtain the permit, and more importantly, the unlimited entry permit issued to residents of Shenzhen\u2014a Mainland metropolitan city adjacent to Hong Kong\u2014was evoked.

Brian Buchwald: It is a chain process. The first link of the chain will be the fact that the Chinese consumers have become so important for these big brands. So if you are looking to build a successful retail business [there], you need to build it with Chinese consumers. If you look at Chinese consumers, you have to understand their purchasing habits. To be specific, when looking at their discovery habits in terms of how they start to make decisions about what they want to buy, influencers play such a dominating role in that process.", "Some luxury brands choose to work with celebrities, while others like fashion bloggers. What is the difference between them?  They are certainly different use cases. So if you think about the use of celebrities, [brands] want to be associated (more passively) with celebrities through both offline and online media. For instance, you choose a celebrity who becomes the face of your brand, they wear your products to offline events. There is a more expensive situation when [brands] make them your brand ambassador. That is a typical way to ensure a lot of images. Your brand image is proliferated along with the celebrity\u2019s in a really meaningful way.", "[The use of] bloggers is a little bit more directed. They usually have specific areas of expertise. What brands would do with bloggers is to give them products to build a relationship. Then the blogger will write about that brand or do a video tutorial with that brand, where it becomes a very specific use case of description and utility of the brands along with that bloggers. Also, bloggers have a much smaller but more directed fan base than that of the global celebrities.", "Should luxury brands work with celebrities who have more than one partnership?\u00a0 I think it is an even larger issue in the West, where consumers are less forgiving of celebrities and bloggers working with too many brands. They tend to lose authenticity. In China, we still see the same thing, but you do have celebrities, whether it is Angelababy or Yang Mi who work with a number of brands. There is typically one brand that they are best known for, whether it is Dior or Michael Kors.

Yes. If you look at Dior, Tag Heuer, and UGG, these are three very different product bases. You are talking about luxury, affordable watch, and contemporary footwear brands. In that case, Angelababy is definitely walking the tightrope in a sense that she has to be careful and the brands who work with her, every extra brand that works with her, has to be aware of the fact that she has become so well-known by being associated with certain brands like Dior.", "However, if you are UGG, and you start working with Angelababy, you also get the benefit of the brand association [that] she is creating with the brand Dior, which is tremendously positive. So the question to me, would almost be more for Dior: Do they want her to work with UGG? Does that actually dilute the value of their partnership?", "What are some misconceptions that brands have when choosing KOLs?  First off, we noticed that global leadership is abdicating all the responsibilities to the local China team. There is definitely a belief on our part that the Chinese team is better than the global team in working with KOLs. But it is important for the global team to have some oversight of what the local team is doing, and understand whether it meets the brand promise and the trust they build with the global consumers over the years and decades.", "As it relates to China specifically, this is not going to be revolutionary, but it really becomes more now about the quality of the interaction that the KOLs generate, rather than just the number of interactions. For instance, one of the things we see in the market right now is the concept of the \u201cyoung [little] fresh meat\u201c: all these very attractive young men that brands are increasingly adopting as KOLs, who drive tremendous reach and engagement. [However], typically what we look at is the product interaction and purchase intent. [Little fresh meat] drive very low product interaction and very low purchasing intent.

What we tend to focus on is [to understand] what was the quality of collaboration these KOLs have done previously with other brands. It is not just who they have worked with, but the effectiveness of those collaborations and brand equity that has been built along with that celebrity.", "We also dive into the audience and fan bases of those celebrities. It is one thing for the celebrity to have the large fan base, but another thing for celebrities to drive high sentiment and purchase intent and high engagement. It is still another thing to understand whether that audience is in line with the brands.", "[In addition], we also think it is important to understand where the KOL is with their professional life and where they are with their personal life.

Opening its API to the public and continually rolling out new functionality has contributed to expanding the horizons of digitally active luxury brands. Over time, these new platform services, and the ease of connecting WeChat to external databases thanks to its API, led WeChat to be viewed as an established service-oriented platform. Compared to other Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo, WeChat never limited itself to simple content broadcasting.", "Fully aware of this evolution and the opportunity it provided, luxury fashion brands started to develop WeChat-specific features through their official accounts, that took advantage of the added-value services offered by WeChat.", "", "Today, two-thirds of the luxury fashion brands active on WeChat now operate a service account, a step up from subscription accounts, which are primarily used by news and media entities. Gucci, for example, which was an early WeChat adopter, transitioned last month its subscription account, followed by hundreds of thousands of followers, into a new service account to better complement its basic content broadcasting activities.

Upon scanning the QR code, users will be redirected to Gucci\u2019s new service account.", "Key differences between WeChat subscription and service accounts.", "Operating a service account without providing service-oriented features represents a missed opportunity and lack of alignment with consumer expectations. One of the first features that brands prioritized was anything that would generate in-store traffic, and the store locator was key to that.", "Today, 88 percent of luxury fashion brands active on WeChat offer a store locator feature. User experience of such features was a challenge in the past (with Google Maps blocked or partially working in China), but we now observe that 73 percent are offering this service through the integration of a local map solution (Baidu Maps, Tencent Maps or Gaode), rather than Google, in order to guarantee an optimal user experience. In addition, 76 percent are offering location-based services, allowing users to directly find a nearby store or directions on how to get there.", "", "The above is a great illustration that brands are now ready to invest in developing the right solutions to support their customer experience, but digging deeper also shows areas where brands can improve. Among the sample of \u00a0brands analyzed, two-thirds are not providing any customer service on WeChat, meaning that in some cases, automated answers would redirect the user to a hotline or the corporate website\u2019s FAQ, and in even worse scenarios, questions were simply left unanswered.", "", "Another relevant illustration is O2O (the acronym for online-to-offline, also referred to as \u201comni-channel\u201d in the West) and how brands are trying to take advantage of WeChat to generate a transaction, or at least stimulate the act of purchase, by driving traffic to both online or offline point of sales. While it may not be a surprise to see that only 24 percent of the luxury fashion brands analyzed were integrating call-to-actions and links to an e-commerce platform, no brands currently offer the possibility to set up an appointment in-store or request a call-back from the sales staff.", "Another major surprise regarded the development of CRM programs through WeChat since only 16 percent of the brands analyzed were providing their users with options to join a loyalty program or simply to register their profile as a client.", "Example of Cartier\u2019s appointment feature on WeChat.", "Last but not least, when analyzing the performance of the store locator functions on WeChat, we realized that only 18 percent provided a service that worked abroad which, when we think about it, is a situation during which a customer would need even more help than when they shop in their home country.", "All in all, the below illustration well summarizes a situation where brands are indeed embracing WeChat and its promise to serve users, but it also shows that a serious commitment to get things right by really understanding customer expectations is required to approach WeChat in a mature way. Online and social CRM have been at the core of most of the strategic discussions led by luxury brands when it comes to WeChat, but it seems that there is still a long way to go before developing WeChat strategies for fashion luxury brands that really goes the way of the users.", "* Data collected by Digital Luxury Group on WeChat on December 31st, 2016, sample of 25 luxury fashion brands include: Balenciaga, Bally, Berluti, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Chanel, Chlo\u00e9, Christian Dior, Coach, DKNY, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Givenchy, Gucci, Herm\u00e8s, Kenzo, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Prada, Saint Laurent, Thomas Pink, Valentino"]}, {"title": "Report: Luxury Brands in China Trail Behind in Digital Proficiency", "meta": "March 7, 2017", "paragraphs": ["Chinese luxury shoppers are possibly the most tech-savvy and digitally friendly consumers in the world.

Burberry in China has fully harnessed all types of available digital channels. It has a Chinese official website that is highly localized for Chinese customers. It also has opened stores on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall, as well as launched an online boutique on WeChat. The brand has also made substantial efforts in offering high-quality customer service and style advisory through phone and social media channels, as well as integrating online and offline shopping experiences. Burberry\u2019s wide e-commerce footprint is in contrast with its rivals, such as Gucci, Prada, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton, which have not yet established any direct e-commerce.", "On the e-commerce front, the study also notes that, in general, Western luxury brands that are willing to sell through this channel tend to go to platforms such as JD.com, Secoo.com and 5lux.com, but keep away from launching flagship stores on Tmall and boutiques via WeChat. One explanation could be that many luxury brands still find it hard to work with Alibaba, as their businesses in China have all, to some extent, suffered from the counterfeit phenomenon on that platform.", "When it comes to the level of localization, Coach, Hugo Boss and Ray-Ban are leading, followed by Armani, Burberry, Cartier, Dior and Michael Kors. A high level of localization requires a brand to pay attention to things such as language and currency, and establish\u00a0official presence on major Chinese sites such as Baidu, WeChat, Weibo, and Youku. Meanwhile, local celebrities and fashion bloggers also play a significant role in helping to localize the brands. For example, Burberry has been working closely with Chinese singer and actor Kris Wu, while Cartier uses singer Lu Han to promote their products.", "The availability of \u201cstyle advisory\u201d is also used as a benchmark to measure brands\u2019 digital performance.

E-commerce is becoming so ingrained in the every day that it shouldn\u2019t stand apart from any other way to shop.

How can I use WeChat to develop a social CRM strategy and better deliver personalized content to my audience?", "This was a question that John Hamilton, Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts\u2019 Director of Marketing Communications for the APAC region, asked himself.

Working with Digital Luxury Group as their social media agency of record in China, Four Seasons began testing and optimizing the hotel group\u2019s WeChat experience in order to better understand consumer demands.", "There were a few key challenges that Four Seasons had to work through when getting started. Limited follower data was available on WeChat, activities had been limited to broadcasting messages without a lot of feedback\u00a0from the audience, and it was hard to drive bookings from WeChat.", "With those challenges in mind, a CRM approach was built. First, advanced analytics were put in place to better understand follow behaviors and actions. Next, audience segmentation and targeted content was unveiled with a goal to personalize the message. And finally, the audience was given a\u00a0call-to-action when appropriate, and their\u00a0intent to book was better tracked.", "Four Seasons and Digital Luxury Group adapted their content strategy on WeChat to maintain a good balance between outbound and inbound destinations.

By segmenting according to interests, they were able to push out customized messages and generate better results. The four key segments that were initially defined were: food and beverage audiences, inbound travelers, outbound travelers, and those most interested in\u00a0promotions.", "While more insights were shared, the basic takeaway\u00a0for brands and companies looking to start their WeChat CRM was that by analyzing who your audience is and what they\u2019re most interested in, you can easily start to push targeted messages to targeted groups at the most opportune time, resulting in better call-to-action results.", "5.

Because Valentine\u2019s Day is such a sweet day full of love, we figured it might be the very day that can bring Bagfans the most happiness. Plus, we collaborated with Dior on Chinese Valentine\u2019s Day (Qixi Festival in August), which was the first time a luxury brand sold handbags through WeChat. Out of 200 limited-edition pink Lady Dior bags, Bagfans purchased more than 110 of them.

With Givenchy, we worked really well together.", "How do you balance partnerships and sponsorships with your own content? Do you ever worry about conflicts of interest or not being able to have the freedom to tell your readers what you truly think about a collection?", "Actually, I never think of partnerships and sponsorships as contradictions to a blogger\u2019s development. The real obstacles are the content that readers either don\u2019t need or they don\u2019t want to see. That\u2019s why we never rule out business collaborations as long as they are beneficial to my Bagfans. To be honest, we are very picky about who we work with. Most of the brands and clients we have worked with have all been high-end international brands that Bagfans are most interested in.

What kinds of handbags are they looking for?", "My followers are the best! As for what they want in handbags, they are like most girls. They want bags that are great for different events and occasions. They want to have bags that can express their styles and personality. They want bags that are practical and versatile, but that doesn\u2019t mean they want all of these characteristics in one bag.

What is your biggest piece of advice as a blogger?", "First of all, I have to say I\u2019m really honored. I didn\u2019t expect that to happen because I never really think about comparing myself with others. The most important thing to me is to always create the best content and to be responsible for my fans. I think a blogger should never forget why he started blogging. Also, one must have his own trademark. There are so many bloggers out there, so why would your fans want to keep following you? That\u2019s where it\u2019s important that one\u2019s own characteristics stand out.", "Do you expect to work with Givenchy in the future?

Such concern was expressed earlier this year when lingerie brand Victoria\u2019s Secret sent dragon-decorated supermodels to the runway during its annual show. Another example is ETRO\u2019s Chinese New Year-themed scarf, which has a phoenix pattern on it. Mr. Bags, China\u2019s handbag guru as well as a famous fashion blogger, questioned the original intent of this design in a WeChat post. Commenting on the choice to use the phoenix on a shawl to celebrate the holiday during the year of the rooster, he commented that he was not sure whether the brand chose it because they designers could not tell the difference between a phoenix and a rooster.

But the product seemed to attract an especially high number of negative comments and a low number of positive ones from Chinese netizens on Weibo.

The New Year-themed items from Calvin Klein stand out as a typical example of a brand accused of being guilty of this type of mistake. One commentator said on Weibo, \u201cIf I spend that much amount of money on it, why would I want to buy something that looks like a fake?\u201d Another user said, \u201cThe design is so tacky.

However, the era in which Chinese people will just buy whatever luxury brands make has gone. Their tastes have evolved remarkably as the luxury market matures in China. The social media backlash that has happened in recent two years has sent a message to all luxury brands that hope to cash in on this special occasion: Chinese customers\u2019 opinions cannot be ignored when making China-related products.

More repatriation of Chinese luxury spending. Chinese luxury travelers still love to shop abroad, but this year, mainland China saw more domestic consumption, with Bain & Company predicting that mainland China\u2019s luxury market will have returned to growth by the end of 2016 (final numbers are still yet to come out). Meanwhile, a study by ContactLab found that the percentage of luxury goods purchased abroad decreased year-on-year in the first four months of 2016 from 43 percent to 40 percent. ", "This has been due to several key trends, including the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on gray-market smugglers, changes in tariff policies for travelers, importers, and cross-border online sellers, luxury brands\u2019 decisions to harmonize their China prices with those globally, and the Chinese government\u2019s development of duty-free shopping. With the Chinese government aiming to earn tax revenue and luxury brands hoping to cut down on the gray market, expect these trends to continue in the coming year.", "2.\u00a0Price-savvy\u00a0Chinese shoppers will continue to follow currency changes abroad. Despite the increase in spending at home, luxury shopping certainly won\u2019t cease to be a favorite pastime for outbound Chinese travelers anytime soon. One of the main factors driving the next hot shopping spot? Currency. Despite new tariff policies, some brands lowering their China prices, and a devalued yuan, many goods still cost more in China than they do elsewhere, and Chinese shoppers are very aware of prices and global currency fluctuations. When the pound plunged because of the Brexit vote this year, Chinese tourists flocked to the UK to scoop up lower-priced goods, while their currency-driven \u201cexplosive shopping\u201d in Japan calmed when the yen rose in value.", "3. E-commerce will remain a bright spot for growth with a focus on mobile. E-commerce is gaining ground globally in the luxury industry, and China is no exception. Around 80 percent of luxury brands are now available online in China in some form or another, whether it bet a direct-to-consumer site or presence on a third-party e-commerce platform, while only 14 percent of fashion brands and 25 percent of watch and jewelry brands have no China e-commerce presence at all.", "Mobile shopping is especially important, with mobile sales estimated to have grown by 51.4 percent year-on-year to reach $505.74 billion\u00a0in 2016 (based on preliminary data). If they stay on track, they\u2019re expected to grow by 45.7 percent in 2017, making up 61 percent of all e-commerce sales, according to China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. As a result, even as brands remain wary of opening online shops through Alibaba\u2019s Tmall, more are looking to WeChat sales as a way to reach Chinese consumers through a \u201cVIP\u201d-style shopping experience.

With Xi Jinping approaching his five-year mark of an expected 10, there will be no letup in China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign that coincided with a plunging luxury sales growth rate when it began in 2012. In a report on a Politburo meeting, Xinhua reported on Wednesday that the anti-corruption campaign \u201chas gained crushing momentum,\u201d and stated that \u201cin 2017 existing corruption should be reduced, and any rise in corruption contained\u201d with a \u201chigh-voltage\u201d crackdown on \u201cundesirable work styles and corruption.\u201d For the luxury industry, this simply means that brands that didn\u2019t rely on official \u201cgifting\u201d-related sales before the campaign will continue to thrive off marketing efforts geared toward regular consumers purchasing for themselves, family, or friends.

Burberry, however, seems to be reaping the rewards of an official store on Tmall, with Alibaba successfully clamping down on removing all fake and gray-market Burberry items.

Ultimately, this concern may be the primary reason why more luxury brands have yet to jump at the chance to sign on to Tmall\u2019s growing platform. There is certainly a market for big buyers, with brands like Maserati unveiling huge rewards schemes for the 11.11 festival this year, but the presence of unofficial third-party sellers of luxury brands will continue to cause companies to feel uneasy about being thrown in with this pick and mix of quality.

When this is the case, it is important to have the store locator very visible on the site. Addressing the limitations of Google (and Google Maps more specifically) in China and proposing a global mapping system that can be accessed both from China and overseas to search both for point of sales in China and abroad is the best solution.

This is especially beneficial for Christie\u2019s owner\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, who also owns luxury conglomerate and Bottega Veneta parent company Kering and will have a big advantage if more Kering brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga are sold through Christie\u2019s in the future.", "As the luxury world becomes increasingly assertive\u00a0that at least some of its products could be considered true\u00a0works of art, there is concern among\u00a0curators about commercialization and their growing reach into the art world.

This has coincided with an unrelenting China slump for Swiss luxury watch sales brought on by the ongoing anti-corruption campaign. The decidedly high-tech partnership marks a turning point for Herm\u00e8s, which has been able to maintain sales success in uncertain times for luxury thanks to a heavily cultivated exclusivity factor (including, paradoxically, a low digital presence).", "Given the low number of Apple\u2019s smartwatch sales compared to the brand\u2019s other devices, the jury is still out on whether or not the Apple Watch will be considered a \u201csuccess\u201d both in China and globally. Apple Watch faces many challenges in the years ahead\u2014competition from new NFC-enabled watches and \u201csmart\u201d bands by traditional watch brands, the problem of quick obsolescence, the need to own an accompanying iPhone, and screen-size limitations could all hinder future sales growth.

Before creating their own lines, many of these designers got their start at the world\u2019s top fashion houses: Masha Ma previously worked for Alexander McQueen and Huishan Zhang got his start at Christian Dior.

Since celebrities in attendance often dress according to the theme, we\u2019re likely to see a large swathe of stars wearing dresses by Chinese designers for the first time (and, for those who choose not to go with a Chinese designer, hopefully no displays of offensive cultural appropriation \u00e0 la Katy Perry).

The main themes of the video are not glitz and glamour, but rather the use of hard work and creative vision to accomplish what one truly wants in life. \u201cOften, people make choices based on money and time. It\u2019s not fun to have a world like this,\u201d asserts Chen in the video embedded below.", "", "The campaign aims to position Mercedes-Benz as the car of the creative class by having each of the featured figures design a creative video featuring a Mercedes-Benz model. As with any successful social media outreach, it also asks users to participate by posting their own dreams for the chance to win a Mercedes-Benz.", "Mercedes-Benz isn\u2019t the only brand to use motivational role models other than actors and major pop stars. Johnnie Walker recently used an almost identical marketing technique with its \u201cGame Changer\u201d campaign, featuring Septwolves Chairman Zhou Shaoxiang,\u00a0MAD Architects\u00a0founder Ma Yansong, and Cannes Best Screenplay winner and director\u00a0Jia Zhangke. The whiskey brand had previously used an unnerving CGI \u201cback-from-the-dead\u201d Bruce Lee for an earlier \u201cGame Changer\u201d ad, but opted this time around for creative types. The videos are remarkably similar to those of Mercedes-Benz, featuring the figures discussing how they had reached success through thinking outside the box, and their advice for others hoping to do the same.", "In addition to creative figures, brands have also used professional athletes for a similar marketing technique. A\u00a0campaign by luxury duty-free retailer DFS \u00a0featured Olympic fencing champion Lei Sheng alongside\u00a0fashion designer Guo Pei, photographer Xiao Quan, and pianist Zhao Yinyin for its \u201cpinnacle moment\u201d ad that it released for its annual luxury timepiece exhibition last year. The role models were asked in the video to describe the \u201cpinnacle moment\u201d of their lives and how they reached it.", "The marketing value of these inspirational \u201crole model\u201d campaigns in China can likely be attributed to several factors. First, brands are hoping to distance themselves from perceptions of luxury products as symbols of corruption, which has been exacerbated by the Chinese government\u2019s ongoing anti-graft campaign. In a recent Business of Fashion op-ed, iLook editor Hong Huang stated that in China, \u201cluxury is no longer associated with beauty and exceptional craftsmanship; instead, it is associated with corruption and moral dilapidation.\u201d Brands are using these figures to align themselves with the idea that their goods are purchased by professionals who actually earned their money through hard work and creativity, as opposed to being the brands preferred by corrupt officials or spoiled fuerdai (second-generation rich).", "Connected to this idea is also the growing sophistication of Chinese consumers. Those who use Sina Weibo in particular are in general more educated and show disdain for ostentatious displays of wealth associated with China\u2019s nouveau riche. The brands\u2019 \u201crole model\u201d campaigns intend to show off an understated sense of class to make sure that their products don\u2019t become categorized as something China\u2019s \u201ccoal bosses\u201d would like.", "In addition, these campaigns reveal an attempt to appeal deeply to consumers\u2019 life aspirations as China\u2019s economy grows and middle-class incomes rise. The brand ambassadors\u2019 sincere and heartfelt discussions are intended to inspire viewers to believe that hard work, dedication, and vision can pay off with not only material wealth, but life satisfaction. This strategy utilizes Chinese consumers\u2019 hopes about their own future to position the brand as representative not just of wealth, but also of success and happiness."]}, {"title": "Jing Daily\u2019s China Luxury Brief", "meta": "November 7, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Welcome to\u00a0Jing Daily\u2019s China Luxury Brief: the day\u2019s top news on the business of luxury and culture in China, all in one place.

In line with this trend, a recent\u00a0article on Xinhua\u00a0conveniently rounds up a number of state media criticisms of foreign luxury brands which all have one thing in common: not much evidence.", "In the article, Xinhua lists a collection of reports dating from 2008 to the present accusing\u00a0Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Dior, Gucci, Armani, and Fendi of a wide range of infractions including selling fakes at their official boutiques worldwide, producing low-quality goods that fall apart soon after purchase, and behaving unfairly toward customers when they complained.", "In one example of the sub-par research that went into many of these stories, the piece\u00a0cites a 2012 article\u00a0in which a \u201cMr. Wei\u201d bought a pair of Louis Vuitton shoes in Tianjin that allegedly split open 10 days after he bought them. When he took them back to the store for return, the storekeepers allegedly only sent pictures of the shoes to company\u2019s China headquarters, which reportedly told him that the frequency of use and his environment had caused the damage. Straying from typical journalism guidelines, the article doesn\u2019t bother to say the name of the store, provide a photo of the shoes, or try to get a quote from LV on the issue. Showing a little more effort in the story of a \u201cMs. Wang\u201d who experienced similar problems at the Tianjin Friendship Store, the article claims that LV\u2019s Shanghai headquarters reportedly said it was still in talks with the store, and that the store was unauthorized to comment on behalf of LV. A year and a half later, the Xinhua article dutifully re-reports the story with equally few details and no follow-up with anyone involved.", "Despite the minimal evidence, the articles make some pretty extreme claims. According to a Legal Evening News article, in 2012, someone named Ms. Sun (however, this is just an alias, it helpfully notes) bought Fendi sandals that fell apart soon after she wore them. According to her, the storekeeper allegedly told her that Fendi used \u201cItalian glue\u201d which naturally came undone, and she wasn\u2019t allowed to return them.", "The piece doesn\u2019t just go after stores in China, but also criticizes international boutiques with equally little evidence. For example, it states that \u201ca woman with the surname Guo\u201d recently told Shanghai Securities News that that four out of six bags she allegedly bought at official\u00a0Herm\u00e8s\u00a0boutiques in Europe turned out to be fake. Meanwhile, a \u201cBeijing actress\u201d with no name provided whatsoever also supposedly bought a Herm\u00e8s\u00a0handbag worth 700,000 RMB\u00a0\u201cin the UK\u201d that turned out to be fake as well. The author of the article apparently felt that basic facts, such as the store in which they were purchased or a quote from the brand, were unnecessary.", "South Korea\u2019s Shilla Duty-Free is to be avoided as well, implies the article, which cites several instances of Chinese purchases of items such as a Dior bag and Jaeger-LeCoultre watch that were allegedly defective, and when the buyers tried to return the items at the brand offices in China, they were supposedly told that it was Shilla\u2019s responsibility and not the brands\u2019. The article doesn\u2019t say if there was any follow-up with Shilla.", "Chinese state media critiques of foreign companies are not uncommon, and generally relate to complaints that Western companies are giving Chinese customers service which is inferior to that provided in other countries. The most widely publicized incidents this year have been CCTV\u2019s botched critique of Apple\u00a0and complaints that a Vera Wang boutique in Shanghai was charging a $500 \u201ctry-on fee\u201d.", "However, this report also manages to go after international boutiques, showing that it\u2019s also trying to send the message that this \u201cproblem\u201d can\u2019t be resolved by simply purchasing luxury goods elsewhere, which Chinese buyers already do for 60 percent of the luxury goods they purchase.", "CCTV\u2019s anti-Apple campaign earlier this year was heavily derided by netizens when Taiwanese-American movie star Peter Ho posted a complaint about the company which accidentally included a directive of what time he should post it, causing users to call him out for being paid to do it. This Xinhua article on luxury goods does not have an equally extensive social media component. A search of Weibo does find a recent post by user @\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9ed1\u52a0\u4ed1\u5b50\u00a0 claiming that she had bought a fake bag at Louis Vuitton in Portland, OR. However, she only has about 1,000 followers, so it\u2019s unlikely she was put up to it by Chinese state media. The post features several pictures of the bag such as the one to the right and claims:", "Omnipotent North America! A shocking event happened today: at Portland\u2019s Louis Vuitton I bought an Alma bag. After I returned to LA, I felt I didn\u2019t need it and went to the store to return it, but the LA store told me that it was a fake. Attached are photos of the details; I want to make everyone aware. The places where it\u2019s not the same [as the real]: the bag\u2019s body is not stiff 2. the color is not right on the outside 3. the color is not right on the inside. Everyone look for yourself!", "It\u2019s impossible to tell from this Weibo post what the exact story is\u2014there\u2019s no way to prove that this bag was actually purchased at an official store\u2014but it\u2019s quite telling that the Xinhua article provides even less evidence than the aforementioned microblogger for its claims. The outlet\u2019s reasoning for publishing the piece was likely an attempt to gain the same amount of attention that Chinese media outlets gained for the Vera Wang \u201ctry-on fee\u201d story: stories of unfair treatment toward Chinese customers by Western brands are able to generate feelings of outrage that cause a story to go viral. The Vera Wang story managed to go viral because it was indeed true, but in this case, netizens have not felt equally compelled to comment on Xinhua\u2019s less-than-extensive research."]}, {"title": "Jing Daily\u2019s China Luxury Brief: October 1, 2013", "meta": "October 1, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Welcome to\u00a0Jing Daily\u2018s China Luxury Brief: the day\u2019s\u00a0top news on the business of luxury and culture in China, all in one place.

The average vacancy rate for malls in second-tier cities\u00a0is currently 10.5 percent, and much higher in individual cities such as Shenyang, where the rate stands at 17 percent. In addition, despite growing populations, these cities lack labor forces\u00a0skilled in high-end luxury retail, leaving brands wary of diluting their images through sub-par service.", "Another challenge is different and unfamiliar consumer behavior.

Consumers with less brand knowledge may serve as a \u201cblank slate\u201d for companies to educate about a label\u2019s heritage, and real estate is less expensive and easier to come by than in larger locations. Entering these cities early also avoids the risk of the market becoming saturated before a brand can establish itself, a challenge currently facing many companies in the upper tier. Additionally, both Chinese and smaller foreign brands have more breathing room in these cities with less competition from the world\u2019s fashion behemoths.", "The Mixc luxury mall in Hangzhou.", "As labels remain vigilant about identifying the right time to expand to the lower tiers, China\u2019s rapidly growing e-commerce market remains an increasingly popular alternative to brick-and-mortar stores.

Although consumers from these cities also travel to the first tier to make purchases, the rate at which they are using e-commerce is growing.

These include not only the anti-extravagance campaign and changing consumer taste, but also China\u2019s overall slowing economic growth.", "The Chinese government is working hard to convince the public that it will no longer tolerate taxpayer money going to lavish banquets. (Global Post)", "There is no doubt that the anti-corruption campaigns are in fact taking their toll. Some industries notorious for thriving off official \u201cgifting\u201d practices, such as luxury watches and Chinese spirits, have been much harder hit than others on a timeline that coincides very closely with the corruption crackdown.\u00a0Industries associated with official banquet culture are also suffering, including high-end restaurants, five-star Beijing hotels, suppliers of expensive food delicacies,\u00a0 high-end catering, and even the flower industries associated with providing banquet centerpieces. \u201cNo industry that has relied on official spending is safe it seems,\u201d says Abe Sauer at BrandChannel.", "Some companies are even willing to admit publicly that they\u2019ve been hurt by the crackdown. For example, Pernod Ricard blamed the campaign on its drop in whisky sales, and when Burberry\u2019s numbers were not looking so good, the company\u2019s chief financial officer Stacey Cartwright publicly admitted that gift-giving culture had been an important source of revenue for the company.", "However, looking at the fact that not all individual companies are doing terribly makes the picture much more complicated. Despite the fact that the crackdown hasn\u2019t ended, Burberry, for example, has since bounced back. Meanwhile, some comparatively low-key fashion companies are doing quite well, while haute couture lines are still working on expanding their presence in the country.\u00a0This points to the argument that changing consumer habits which lean toward less ostentatious, logo-heavy styles may be driving this trend.\u00a0\u201cThe truth is, the luxury market in China was in decline well before the anti-corruption campaign was introduced,\u201d states Business of Fashion, which argues, \u201cWhile many consumers still purchase luxury goods with blatant logos stamped across them as loud displays of status and wealth \u2026 new consumption patterns can be seen, especially amongst young people.\u201d", "Further complicating the issue is the fact that it is difficult to tell how much of this decline in an obsession with \u201cbling\u201d is influenced by the crackdown itself. Watches once again provide the most obvious example of officials taking pains to avoid conspicuous displays of wealth. According to Euromonitor International, \u201cThis time last year, there were more Chinese government officials and company executives sporting Cartier or Rolex timepieces than you could shake a stick at. Today, many of those same luxury timepieces are locked up in drawers at home or are on sale at second-hand stores such as Brand Off in Shanghai. Most government officials wouldn\u2019t be seen dead wearing one.\u201d Even officials\u2019 wives haven\u2019t been exempt from being called out on Weibo for the logos on their handbags, showing that not all stealth wealth may be simply a matter of voluntary change of taste. \u00a0Although Chinese consumers\u2019 tastes have been getting more sophisticated on their own, it\u2019s hard to tell how much this trend is being helped along by government diatribes against ostentation.", "Also not to be discounted are China\u2019s slowing economic growth and the amount of government funding going to public works. China is still heavily invested in driving economic growth through the funding of infrastructure projects, but as economic recovery has progressed since the 2008 crisis, the government has been less extravagant with its public financing of these projects. Although not connected to the anti-extravagance campaign, less public money for major projects leads to far less opportunity for bribery, which in turn may be indirectly contributing to the slowdown. In addition, China\u2019s lower-than-predicted GDP growth numbers and the economic uncertainty accompanying the leadership transition may have had their impacts on retail.", "The bottom line is that even amidst all this short-term uncertainty, luxury companies still see China as an investment for the long run. Although they may be adjusting their expansion strategies for now, they still see the world\u2019s largest luxury market as first and foremost a growth opportunity."]}, {"title": "China\u2019s Fashion Market in Transition: Winners Emerge As Competition Heats Up", "meta": "May 20, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Dior Homme\u2019s recent Beijing runway show.

China\u2019s increasingly experienced consumers want to be more low-key in their spending and to differentiate themselves from their peers.\u00a0This is creating opportunities for brands poised to capture this more sophisticated consumer, and challenges for those left behind as tastes change.

E-commerce and social media play heavily into the decision-making process of today\u2019s more sophisticated consumers. In recent focus groups of offline and online luxury consumers conducted by my firm, both groups followed essentially the same process of \u201cSocial media to e-commerce via mobile, to e-commerce via PC, to store visit\u201d before coming to a purchasing decision.

Consumers are acutely aware of this price difference and are ready to use a multitude of channels to bypass it, most importantly travel and overseas shopping agents.

The resulting price pressure has been felt most acutely by traditional mass-market retailers, many of whom are beginning to view e-commerce as a key source of competition.", "Luxury e-commerce sites such as The Outnet have been proliferating in China.", "Despite this focus on price, consumers are willing to spend more on individual items as they gain experience (and trust) in the online channel: the common perception of an \u2018expensive\u2019 online item has doubled from $80 in 2010 to around $160 today. With e-commerce becoming more premium, luxury brands and retailers are entering the space in increasing numbers. As they do so, they are encountering a similar challenge to that faced by their offline stores: how to cater to their loyal, omni-channel customer while at the same time attracting the rising spending power of price-focused, heavy e-commerce users. Only by addressing both groups can brands unlock the full potential of the e-commerce channel.", "Winners and Losers", "How brands are doing in the market today is largely a reflection of how well they have been able to deal with these consumer and structural trends. Herm\u00e8s, for example, is posting strong growth from sophisticated consumers while Louis Vuitton is weighed down by its prominent logo, from both a consumer and a policy perspective.

But one bright spot in the China luxe landscape made news today: Burberry\u2019s counterintuitively higher-than-expected second-half revenue numbers.", "The recent short-term stock dip affected both LVMH and Burberry, as well as other global luxury companies such as\u00a0PPR\u00a0and Richemont, and has been attributed by experts as strongly connected to China\u2019s slowdown news. This week\u2019s report revealed that the country experienced 7.7 percent GDP growth this quarter \u2014 a decrease from last quarter that contradicted expert predictions forecasting a higher figure.\u00a0LVMH\u2019s fashion and leather goods division took the biggest hit, sinking by 3.5 percent on Tuesday\u00a0to a five-month low. But LVMH\u2019s decrease isn\u2019t just short term; on Monday, the brand reported\u00a0 its worst quarterly sales growth since 2009.", "Burberry, though, became a\u00a0bright spot for luxury\u00a0in China, surprising experts with relatively high growth numbers. The company, which experienced plunging stocks in September, today reported a 10 percent rise in fourth quarter revenue.

In an interview with Reuters, LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony attributed LVMH\u2019s sluggishness\u00a0to both factors, stating that\u00a0China\u2019s \u201ceconomic growth is not what is used to be \u2026 And the change in leadership has had some consequences in terms of gifting.\u201d Meanwhile,\u00a0plunging sales of luxury\u00a0baijiu, a common \u201cgift\u201d for officials and staple at now-banned luxury banquets, are clearly attributable to the crackdown.", "Burberry\u2019s success has shown that it is not impossible for luxury companies to prevail amidst the slowdown. In fact, LVMH\u2019s wine and spirits division has also\u00a0actually fared better\u00a0than its clothing and leather goods, thanks to rising demand in China\u00a0for Hennessy Cognac\u00a0among younger drinkers.", "To deal with the overall decrease in sales, luxury sectors have taken a variety of approaches. Some high-end fashion retailers have braked their expansion plans and switched to\u00a0a focus on high-end consumers; others have considered lowering their prices.\u00a0LVMH has been following the measured-growth approach,\u00a0favoring a freeze on Louis Vuitton\u2019s global expansion and developing more upmarket products.", "Louis Vuitton has also joined many brands in adopting a strategy of downplaying logo-heavy fashions and accessories in favor of subtler, less ostentatious displays of wealth.\u00a0The label recently launched an advertising campaign in China featuring a bag on which its ubiquitous, world-renowned logo was\u00a0conspicuously absent.", "In other fields, price decreases may accompany decreased demand. According to a\u00a0recent Financial Times report, upscale service industries such as catering and floral designers, which thrived on the roaring banquet culture, may need to downshift their market and lower their prices to attract more middle-class consumers.

They are connoisseurs of the luxury lifestyle, enjoying the best wine and luxury bespoke holidays, as well as the highest quality in clothing and accessories.", "This group is difficult to reach, as they move in tightly-knit peer circles, preferring to socialize at home or in the privacy of exclusive clubs. Brands have to be very careful when engaging with this group: the new nobility is profoundly nationalistic, and increasingly attracted to domestic luxury brands. And in light of the recent anti-corruption campaigns, brands that make use of subtle luxury cues as opposed to ostentatious displays of wealth are likely to gain increasing favor among those consumers with strong links with the Party.", "Luxury brands looking to capture both middle-class aspirants and new nobility need to address the dynamic that cuts across both groups: the \u201cupgrade\u201d mindset.

Now that outbound Chinese tourist-shoppers have swooped in to buoy the luxury market in Europe, spending an average of 11,000 euros on shopping per trip, according to Global Blue, European luxury retailers have moved quickly to cater to this important demographic. Along with making the usual adjustments, like hiring Mandarin-speaking staff and increasing Chinese-language signage, some brands have focused more intently on their \u201cVIP\u201d service for big-spending Chinese travelers and opened new points of sale aimed squarely at their shopping habits.", "Yet back in China, despite the construction of new and ever more lavish flagship stores, luxury retail staff haven\u2019t quite perfected this level of bending over backwards for their customers. And this, along with high prices, is causing grumbles among domestic shoppers. Pampered in Europe and North America, often slighted at home, a recent survey by the Beijing-based World Luxury Association recently found that Chinese luxury shoppers consider poor and uneven customer service their biggest pet peeve. Surprisingly, the brands whose level of customer service is complained about the most in the survey are actually some of the largest in the country, with Prada, Chanel and Louis Vuitton staff singled out as the worst performers.", "According Ernst & Young, luxury consumption in China amounted to only US$2 billion in 2004. Last year, consumption rose around 25 percent, reaching over $15.6 billion. Though this year\u2019s growth rate is expected to slow down somewhat, China is still on track to become the world\u2019s largest luxury market by 2015. But it\u2019s this speed of change in the market \u2014 and the speed of brand expansion \u2014 that has been arguably the key factor leading to inconsistent customer service. Quite simply, there\u2019s been no time to bring standards up to international levels. A historical and cultural bias towards the service industry, and \u201crevolving door\u201d turnover in the industry, too, continues to impact the motivation for staff members to improve their customer service skills and complicates matters for managers.", "Bernard Arnault, Maggie Cheung and other VIPs cut the ribbon at Beijing's Dior flagship, December 2011", "As the WLA survey notes, one of the biggest complaints among Chinese luxury shoppers is the gap between after-sales service in Europe and in China. With the after-sales service infrastructure in China weak and strained due to rapid brand expansion, customer complaints are generally slowly, or inadequately, resolved. According to the survey results, after-sales complaints in China are on average more than 65 percent higher in China than in Europe.", "As the Chinese business site Afinance writes this week, many blame a chronic talent shortage for the relatively poor level of service in China. As a reporter from the Yangcheng Evening News told the site, \u201cMainland China lags behind the service levels of Hong Kong and Singapore because there\u2019s a dearth of talent. Early last year, one top international brand launched in Guangzhou and was offering an annual salary in the hundreds of thousands [of yuan] to find an experienced manager to take control, but it took them six months to find an appropriate candidate.\u201d", "Some are more hopeful that the after-sales and general customer service standards will improve in China over time as the industry matures. As Guangdong Chamber of Commerce executive chairman Huang Wenjie (\u9ec4\u6587\u6770) told Afinance, the fact that China is not currently a \u201ccountry of origin for luxury goods\u201d means after-sales service can\u2019t be done locally as it can in Europe or the US. But, as Huang added, \u201cI believe that, with the luxury tariff adjustment and changes in luxury brand development in China, the gap in the quality of service in China will gradually get closer to Europe.\u201d", "Rather than waiting around for the country to improve on its own, some luxury brands and groups are taking matters into their own hands.

VASTO, which currently operates\u00a0around 300 points of sale throughout China, as well as\u00a0shops in Switzerland and the Middle East and plans to expand to France and the US, positions itself as the \u201cBrooks Brothers of China,\u201d sells apparel,\u00a0Swiss-made watches, French-made pens and Italian\u00a0leather goods. From Bernhardt\u2019s interview:", "IW: Tell us about the Chinese luxury market.", "Marc Bernhardt (MB): China is a huge country with a population of 1.4 billion, but is made up of made very different markets of which differences may be as large as exist between Scandinavia and Italy. However, the \u201cstandardization\u201d as evidenced by similar looking malls with uniform global brand marketing campaigns is leveling the playing fields. Based on the development and penetration (of international) brands, the market is largely divided into first, second, third and even fourth tier areas. First tier markets include Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, which have modern infrastructure and a Westernized consumer. Other tier cities will include cities with a population of around 1 million each. Western brands usually enter China through tier one and two and then work their way down.", "It is amazing to already see particularly the presence of some of the Swatch brands (Tissot, Rado, Longines) in fourth tier areas. So the notion that there is still virgin territory with ignorant consumers can slowly be dismissed.", "IW: So are you saying that China is reaching saturation for luxury products?", "MB: No, on the contrary! There is still plenty of potential and it is forecasted that two-thirds of future wealth creation will particularly take place in tier three and four areas. What I mean to say is that consumers are becoming much more knowledgeable and you have to have a credible brand and story to tell. To a large extent this is the problem that many Chinese \u201cluxury\u201d brands are facing\u2014and there are many of them, from garments to luxury furniture. Many have been free-riding with adopted European sounding names or blatant copies of existing international brands\u2014some of the examples with derivatives of Gucci, Dior or Boss are almost funny and should keep trademark lawyers very busy.", "IW: But what is the quality like of these Chinese luxury brands?", "MB: Well, some of it is really quite good reaching similar levels as international brands. Actually, you would be surprised to see the high prices, but we can touch on this subject when we talk about the consumers. Again, many international brands already produce many of their items in China, so a certain know-how and savoir faire is present in the Chinese manufacturing base. What Chinese brands lack is instilling a story, a meaning and raison d\u2019\u00eatre in their products. In the past it was sufficient to pretend to be European, preferably with a blond and blue-eyed model advertising the product. Today, this marketing strategy is pass\u00e9. Consumers are asking questions and are generally more critical than in the past. Recently, there was a widely publicized scandal involving a luxury furniture maker that was selling high priced \u201cItalian Made Furniture\u201d that turned out to be low-end Chinese-made\u2014the company needed police protection to fend off angry consumers.", "IW: Tell us about the Chinese Consumer. What distinguishes them from American or European consumers?", "VASTO's roster includes Swiss-made watches and French-made pens", "MB: For many years, China has been the origin of mass-produced goods often at the lower quality end. So perhaps, the impression may be that Chinese consumers having grown up in this environment will not be as demanding as their Western counterparts. This is totally false! I have rarely seen more demanding and finicky consumers. Visitors to Hong Kong may have already observed expensive watches in the shop window wrapped in protective cling film. A Chinese buyer will literally take out a magnifying glass to ascertain that there are no marks of use. Due to the propensity of fakes (from products to bank notes) Chinese are particularly careful. Anecdotally, this is also the reason why in restaurants a chicken (or any other meat dish) will often be served with the head to prove the genuine product.", "On one hand, Chinese consumers will try to achieve a maximum discount, which is the reason why prices are often marked double the suggested price.

", "\u201cIt\u2019s said that people from Daqing buy half of the luxury goods sold in Harbin,\u201d one LV-toting woman proudly told us.", "According to a 2010 Bain report, only around 30 percent of affluent Chinese live and work in top-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 70 percent living outside of these cities. Second- and third-tier cities are widely seen as the future of China\u2019s luxury market, with consumer brand awareness and willingness to buy closing the gap with Beijing and Shanghai consumers. For shoppers at a similar income level, consumption is higher among consumers in second- and third-tier cities than in first-tier cities.", "\u201cOf the seven commercial buildings sold for more than 1 billion yuan (US$157 million) last year, two were in Daqing, including New Mart Shopping Center, which surpassed 1.6 billion,\u201d Daqing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Chen Wanli told reporters, adding that the growing purchasing power in Daqing is attracting the attention of many brands. Data shows that in 2009, per capita retail spending in Daqing reached 17,937 yuan (US$2,823), more than Harbin\u2019s 15,207 yuan ($2,393).", "The city\u2019s purchasing power is so strong that some brands are willing to make exceptions to their typical ways of doing business to take advantage of the boom. At Daqing New Mart, brands like Omega, Longines and Girard Perregaux are surrounded by supermarkets and shanzhai (\u5c71\u5be8) stores. Longines sits around 10 meters away from a supermarket, and Omega shares a wall with a McDonald\u2019s. Still, this hasn\u2019t reduced the city\u2019s enthusiasm for luxury goods. According to a staff briefing, Ulysse Nardin \u2014 which has been in the mall for a year \u2014 sold a Tourbillon watch worth 2 million yuan (US$315,000) last month, and Girard Perregaux has recorded good sales performance for watches ranging in price from 140,000-400,000 yuan. Staff at Omega say they sell \u201cmore than 10 watches per day.\u201d", "\u201cIn addition to more purchasing power, herd mentality and brand recognition are other reasons why Daqing consumers are buying luxury goods,\u201d said Chen Wanli. With luxury consumption in China rising rapidly in recent years, affluent consumers are increasingly becoming more brand-savvy, though many simply learn by imitation. So luxury consumption is still not in the rational stage, and the number of consumers in Daqing still in the conspicuous consumption phase is relatively high.", "\u201cCurrently, first-tier cities in China are the heart of commercial real estate, and as such they\u2019re battlegrounds for foreign brands. To set up shop there, the costs are high. But in second- and third-tier cities like Daqing, business districts are still new and on the rise, so brands can surround potential customers [more easily],\u201d Chen Wanli said. Chen added that this month, a 160,000 square meter Wanda Plaza will open for business. In addition, another four shopping centers will open in Daqing by the end of the year, including Tang Center, the World Olympic Center, and a trendy shopping district. According to media reports, many international luxury brands, such as Versace, Vacheron Constantin, Cartier, Piaget, Rolex and Gucci may soon enter the Daqing market.", "If these major luxury brands do decide to enter the young and relatively untested Daqing market, they\u2019ll likely encounter the same nagging issues they come across in other second- and third-tier cities, namely little familiarity with the local retail real estate market, a dearth of attractive venues, and local talent with little or no high-end retail experience.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "\u201cChinese Collectors Are Basically Looking At Chinese Art\u201d", "meta": "October 24, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Zeng Fanzhi\u2019s \u201cMask Series 1998 No.26\u201d sold for US$2.6 million at the recent Ullens auction in Hong Kong", "With China surpassing Britain to become the world\u2019s second-largest art market by combined auction and gallery sales (which totalled US$8.3 billion last year) and overtaking the US to become the world\u2019s top market by auctions alone, art market observers and auction houses have begun to ask if or when China\u2019s new collectors will turn their eyes to Western artists.

As Sotheby\u2019s Asia chairman Patti Wong recently pointed out, Chinese collectors, like all new collectors, remain fixated upon Chinese artists as \u201call cultures start with their own art.\u201d On the strength of growing demand, new Chinese collectors and even more established \u201csuper-collectors\u201d have, in the space of only three years, turned the Chinese contemporary art market on its head, pushing out many of the formerly dominant Western collectors who originally cultivated the segment a decade ago. This surging demand has fueled a \u201csecond boom\u201d in the Chinese art world, pushing prices for blue-chip artists to new highs in the years following the dip seen after the global economic crisis.", "Currently, as author and art critic Barbara Pollack told the AFP, \u201cChinese collectors are basically looking at Chinese art,\u201d a reality that pushed five Chinese artists to the list of the world\u2019s top 10 last year, as measured by combined sales at auction. (In all, 45 Chinese artists sit on the list of the world\u2019s 100 top sellers, according to Artprice.) While some names, like blue-chip contemporary artists like Zeng Fanzhi, Cai Guo-qiang and Zhang Xiaogang are known (and collected) internationally, many of these top sellers are all but unknown among Western collectors, which reflects the fact that Chinese collectors are no longer looking to the West to dictate auction trends. Said Pollack, \u201cThere are names which are totally fuelled by the Chinese market, some of them traditional ink painters, who are almost unheard of in the West.\u201d", "Yue Minjun \u2013 \u201cUntitled\u201d (2005). Chinese collectors tend to home in on blue-chip artists at auction", "With Chinese artists achieving higher visibility (and sales figures) back home, now we\u2019re starting to see them invited to show at Western art fairs, if only in earnest. As the AFP notes, despite growing participation from Asia, Africa and Latin America, these art fairs typically remain heavily weighted towards Europe and North America. This Euro-centric mindset, which often comes through in articles that contend China\u2019s booming art market is fueled mostly by unsophisticated collectors buying the \u201cwrong\u201d artwork at the \u201cwrong\u201d prices, is dismissed by Pollack, who holds, \u201cthe idea that we are going to teach [Chinese collectors] taste is very narrow minded.\u201d As gallerist Pearl Lam recently told Jing Daily, \u201ctaste\u201d among new Chinese collectors is highly fluid, as buying trends are often dictated by the same factors that are pushing the sales of luxury goods in China. Said Lam:", "If you want to see why artists like Zeng Fanzhi and Zhang Xiaogang attract such high prices, you just have to look at Chinese consumer behavior: they love labels. It\u2019s sort of a lack of confidence. They love Louis Vuitton, they love Christian Dior, and for them to buy a \u201clabel\u201d artist is also part of their fear of taking a risk. They don\u2019t want to make a mistake. Internationally it\u2019s the same phenomenon \u2013 you don\u2019t want to make a mistake.", "Beyond following the buying trends of their peers for fear of \u201cnot making a mistake,\u201d part of the reason new Chinese collectors tend to home in on blue-chip artists (when they can afford them) or pieces from popular historical eras (such as the reign of emperor Qianlong) is that they\u2019re not just buying art for the sake of enriching themselves culturally; They\u2019re buying for investment value. With inflation and yuan appreciation putting pressure on cash assets, and risk increasing for \u201cnon-portable\u201d investments like real estate and stocks, art is seen by many Chinese collectors as a comparatively safe hedge.", "What all this adds up to is that generalities about the Chinese art market, and Chinese collectors, rarely hold true. As Barbara Pollack pointed out last week, the increasing clout of Chinese collectors at auctions in mainland China, Hong Kong, or even in New York means traditional conceptions of the market should be thrown out. \u201cMany people in the West still think of the Chinese art market as a regional phenomenon,\u201d Pollack said.", "\u201cBut the size of it is beginning to prove it can no longer be ignored.

", "Jing Daily (JD): Could you tell us a little about \u201cWindow in the Wall\u201d?", "Pearl Lam (PL): The newest news? 50% of the work is in customs, and they won\u2019t release it. This is the India-China relationship \u2013 not very smooth. Last year there was another exhibition about Indian and Chinese art, and the organizers actually had to delay the opening date 10 days, because the artwork was stuck in customs. So the curator and the artists are all here from India, but the works are stuck in customs. That\u2019s the newest news.", "This exhibition is curated by Guyatri Sinha and Gao Minglu. The goal is to explore, China and India are among the world\u2019s oldest civilizations. Both countries have gone through huge changes and political upheaval, and even though China is labeled as Communist, actually China is as capitalistic as India, and there is a lot of urbanization. So what is the impact of that, relating urbanization with old cultures? Both curators have been addressing these issues within this exhibition. But unfortunately, you won\u2019t see most of that [when it opens] tomorrow.", "JD: It sounds like a metaphor for India-China relations.", "PL: It\u2019s absolutely a metaphor. Just now, I had lunch with an Indian artist and curator, and I asked them, why isn\u2019t there ever a really large Indian exhibition in China, or a large Chinese exhibition in India? And they said to me, \u201cthat is the India-China relationship.\u201d They said Indians are very intimidated by China \u2014 it\u2019s the only country they\u2019re intimidated by \u2014 but when they actually come into China they feel that we are so much more similar, in terms of our traditions, culture, our Buddhist theory.

The general curatorial direction of the gallery has always been focusing on Chinese contemporary art that evolved from tradition, in contradiction to the Western conception that contemporary art here is cut off from tradition. We\u2019ve always said we can\u2019t cut Chinese contemporary art from tradition. We\u2019re a very old culture, we\u2019re an old civilization that hasn\u2019t ended, we didn\u2019t have a dark age. Also, looking at Chinese history and the dynamics of the 20th century, Western contemporary art is all derived from the West and, more specifically, from art in the 20th century and the development of psychology and sociology theory. We didn\u2019t have that. So our evolution just started with Mao\u2019s death in 1976. We\u2019ve been looking at what we have and looking at our culture. As a gallery, we\u2019re looking at [Chinese] artists who have all derived from tradition but have been impacted by Western influence and the Western approach to art.", "JD: You stopped showing at SH Contemporary for a couple of years, what can you say about how the event has changed over the years?", "PL: This year it got a new director and we were asked to support it so we came back, but we were the last gallery to join. So we\u2019ll have to see. Because everyone knows now that Hong Kong is the leading art fair, and Hong Kong has an infrastructure where there\u2019s no censorship and no customs problems. Here there are obvious customs problems, so we\u2019ll have to see what Shanghai will turn out to be. Because if Shanghai will relax these problems, censorship and customs, it can compete with Hong Kong. ", "JD: How do you feel about the role of domestic and local collectors in the Chinese art world? Are you seeing more sophistication among them when they come into your gallery?", "PL: Art collectors, definitely. There are some really coy collectors who are very interesting \u2014 they are curious, they actually care about the curatorial side and make friends with curators. They develop just like [they did] in the West. Then there are the speculators who follow the auction market. And of course they behave differently. Then there are the newcomers who like to buy labels. If you want to see why artists like Zeng Fanzhi and Zhang Xiaogang attract such high prices, you just have to look at Chinese consumer behavior: they love labels.

Most of these really coy people actually go abroad to see shows. But what\u2019s important is the development of private museums and art advisory [services]. But art advisory is different here than it is in the West. Here it\u2019s just like friends sitting together talking about art, it\u2019s more like a salon. An art fair is an art fair. It\u2019s difficult for an art fair to offer a new experience.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: So who is one Chinese artist you think the world really should know about?", "PL: Zhu Jinshi. The way he applies paint so thickly, and some of his large paintings take up to three years to make. He\u2019s an original member of the Stars group who moved to Germany in 1989 or 1990. He was a factory worker there and eventually got an art scholarship. He started off doing installation, and by 2000 he started looking at calligraphy. In China we\u2019ve always considered Western abstract art to be kind of like Chinese calligraphy, so there\u2019s a lot that looks abstract in Western eyes but is derived from calligraphy. Zhu Jinshi\u2019s work is all concerned with questioning emotions, life, and philosophy in a Chinese way. ", "What I want to address in that when there are Chinese paintings like this, people in the West always say they\u2019re derivative, but China had representational art in 700 AD. We were pouring ink on paper centuries before Jackson Pollock. So the West has to also realize that we\u2019re not saying work by Jackson Pollock or anybody is derivative, because their approach and philosophy is so different. So the work is meant to challenge Western arrogance on what they think they know but don\u2019t know.", "JD: So trying in a way to show the universality of art around the world, or closing the circle?", "PL: It\u2019s closing the circle. So, opening the Western world up \u2014 there is another way of looking at art. There\u2019s another approach of looking at art. It\u2019s not about Western dominance, because that\u2019s just like colonialism. In the 1950s, plenty of Western artists were looking at Chinese philosophy. Why is it all of a sudden people suddenly act like it\u2019s a new thing? ", "I think what art brings us is a bigger world. And what I love about art is that I\u2019m learning from people.

Respondents noted that their annual income increased on average 11 percent last year, surpassing the consumer price index (CPI) increase of 6.4 percent.", "Luxury consumers in surveyed cities have moved on to a second phase of high-end consumption, in which their purchases are motivated by a desire to improve quality of life rather than simply show off. These consumers now have a better understanding of the value of luxury goods and more discriminating tastes. Seeing the added value of luxury goods, particularly during a time of economic uncertainty, they see the act of purchasing luxury goods as an act of \u201ccollecting,\u201d one that helps them express their identities and set themselves apart from the general public.", "Expenditure on jewelry and accessories currently accounts for 20.5 percent of total luxury consumption in China, with watches and leather goods making up a similar (but slightly smaller) percentage.", "As of this year, 51 percent of respondents chose Hong Kong as their preferred city for purchasing luxury goods, followed by major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, as well as Japan, Europe and the US. As for Shenzhen-based respondents, almost all of their luxury purchases are now made in Hong Kong, which Huicong calls \u201ca true shopping center for Shenzhenese.\u201d ", "The most popular online buy for respondents this year is luxury watches, with jewelry and accessories ranking second. One noticeable trend in the Chinese luxury market is that 67 percent of regular luxury consumers cite online shopping as their primary motive for Internet use, a massive shift that\u2019s only picked up steam over the past year. However, as Huicong points out, China\u2019s online shopping market is still young, and most of the high-end purchases made by respondents were small items.", "While respondents know how to spend money, they also know how to save and invest it. 32.8 percent of respondents invest a significant amount of their savings in stocks and funds. Huicong finds that gold is also becoming more popular among luxury consumers, accounting for around 20 percent of their total investments.", "Huicong finds that the top deciding factors that drive luxury consumption are brand (with 79.2 percent saying it\u2019s important), style (68.6 percent), and after-sales service (30 percent). Apart from quality, in terms of brand communication, respondents cite word-of-mouth as a validating factor. This, Huicong notes, is cultural, as \u201cChinese consumers have strong family values and like to do things as a group.\u201d Usually, the report adds, the leader of the family or group of friends serves as an \u201copinion leader,\u201d recommending what they like to the rest of the group.", "Huicong points out five attributes common to opinion leaders: 1.) Enjoy trying new things; 2.) Share similar values and lifestyles with other members of the group; 3.) Very active in the group; 4.) Have strong personal charm and authority; 5.) Very knowledgeable about luxury brands.", "Respondents were broadly media-savvy, with 99.8 percent getting most of their brand information from print media and 99.6 percent getting it from the Internet. Huicong found in its research that fewer respondents relied upon radio or television for brand information. The importance of the Internet for brand awareness and high-end consumer education has increased over the past year, driven by the rising popularity of microblogging platforms like Sina Weibo.", "Data & Chart: Huicong Market Research (click for full-size)", "9. Luxury consumers trust television commercials, print media and the Internet more than radio", "The chart at left shows Huicong\u2019s findings about the trust and attention level of luxury consumers towards different advertising media. According to Huicong\u2019s research, Chinese luxury consumers trust television commercials and print media far more than radio or movie theatre marketing. While the Internet does not have the same trust or attention level as television, it is becoming increasingly important for consumers as well as advertisers.", "Huicong cites the recent \u201cGuo Meimei\u201d scandal as an example of the Internet\u2019s attention-raising power. When the scandal broke,\u00a0Chinese netizens targeted much of their ire on Guo\u2019s super-luxury Maserati car. Although the scandal had negative effects on the Red Cross Society of China, where Guo\u00a0initially\u00a0claimed to work, it raised Maserati\u2019s brand visibility in China to new highs. Still, respondents said they still find print media and television advertisements the most trustworthy sources of information.", "The last finding of Huicong\u2019s study is that print media remains the top choice for promotional investment among cosmetic brands. According to the firm\u2019s survey, Estee Lauder, Dior, Opera (Shiseido subsidiary) and Chanel spent more than 300 million yuan (US$47 million) in 2010.", "As always, it pays to take Huicong\u2019s findings with a grain of salt, as we have no sense of their research methodology or sample size. However, as Jing Daily has previously highlighted some of this survey\u2019s findings \u2014 such as the growing demand for online shopping among luxury consumers (and inadequate supply of trustworthy retailers) and strong influence of print media in China \u2014 it seems that Huicong\u2019s report shouldn\u2019t be dismissed out of hand. While not all of Zhai Shuqing\u2019s observations may be \u201cthings we don\u2019t know\u201d about the Chinese luxury market, they\u2019re definitely worth keeping an eye on.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Guangzhou: No Longer A Third-Rate Luxury Market?", "meta": "July 28, 2011", "paragraphs": ["This week, Louis Vuitton opened its largest China flagship at Guangzhou\u2019s Taikoo Hui mall", "While it may be very much a top-tier city, with an annual GDP of over 1 trillion yuan (US$152 billion) \u2014 placing it in an elite group that also includes Beijing and Shanghai \u2014 Guangzhou can be a frustrating market for major luxury brands. Despite the showpiece malls and comparatively high per capita income of Guangzhou residents, top brands have been slow to invest heavily in their Guangzhou operations, and for good reason: local luxury consumption lags far behind other key markets. As one luxury retailer told the Yangcheng Evening News this week, \u201cIn China, for many luxury brands, in terms of luxury consumption, the top cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian. Guangzhou is still not really in that top echelon.\u201d", "Still, brands continue to expand, or make their debut, in Guangzhou. Yesterday, Louis Vuitton opened its largest China flagship in Guangzhou, an 1,800 square meter mega-store at Taikoo Hui mall, and at the city\u2019s La Perle mall, Hermes recently opened a fully remodeled location and Gucci re-entered the city after a seven-year absence. The question now is, will the Guangzhou luxury market finally start to live up to its potential?", "From the Yangcheng Evening News (translation by Jing Daily team):", "As of this year, Hermes, LV, Chanel, GUCCI, Dior, Fendi, Prada and other international luxury brands will have opened locations in Guangzhou. This indicates that the city\u2019s luxury consumption is finally putting it in the country\u2019s top tier. Guangzhou\u2019s luxury market grew rapidly after the city\u2019s hosting of the 2010 Asian Games, with Taikoo Hui [shopping mall] general manager Hao Jilin telling reporters that 70 percent of the brands at his mall are international. This is an eye-catching development. ", "Among them, La Perle\u2019s Hermes location will be the first in Asia to stock the brand\u2019s home furnishings line, and its LV boutique was just renovated at a cost estimated in the eight digits. The city also boasts Chanel\u2019s first location in south China, and Dior will debut its full line at its flagship this November. Since re-launching earlier this year, the Gucci store at La Perle has seen long queues every weekend. As a manager at La Perle pointed out, DKNY and Dior Homme will soon make their Guangzhou debut. As more brands set up shop at La Perle, sales continue to rise. According to a mall spokesman, sales of international top-level brands are increasing by 20 percent per month. ", "While it\u2019s one thing to base perceptions about Guangzhou\u2019s luxury market on the word of a mall spokesperson, the key to addressing whether the city is a good bet for major brands lies in consumer behavior. Up until now, Guangzhou\u2019s proximity to nearby, duty-free Hong Kong has been perhaps the greatest hindrance for luxury brands, as Guangzhou locals have traditionally preferred to simply pop over the border and buy high-end goods at a significant discount. But, as the Yangcheng Evening News holds, this may be changing.", "While Guangzhou\u2019s luxury consumers have the habit of heading to Hong Kong to buy high-end goods, this seems to be slowly changing. It\u2019s been reported that Guangzhou\u2019s regular luxury consumers spent on average 70,000 yuan (US$10,860) more in 2010 than they did the previous year on luxury goods. As a representative of La Perle mall explained, last year the mall\u2019s overall sales rose 25 percent.", "Ultimately, Guangzhou\u2019s sales boost seems to come primarily from the convenience factor. As one shopper told Efu this week at the opening of the new Louis Vuitton flagship at Taikoo Hui, \u201cWe all know that prices [here] are higher than in Hong Kong or overseas, but it\u2019s really convenient.

Although the program is mainly designed to attract tourists from other provinces, it also applies to residents of Hainan. Each eligible non-resident tourists can claim tax rebates twice a year, and Hainan residents can enjoy the privilege once a year.", "Third, if they pay the full import tax, tourists can buy items priced at more than 5,000 yuan. Usually, the import tax rate is far lower than the comprehensive tax rate (which includes customs duties, import VAT and consumption tax) for the same item.

Jewelry, handicrafts and similar items tend to have a 10 percent tax rate, while wine, cigarettes, perfume and cosmetics have a stiffer 50 percent tax rate.", "While Hainan\u2019s new tax exemption policy is a step in the right direction, it\u2019ll likely be a while until the island can seriously rival Hong Kong as a duty-free shopping destination.

While Sanya is rich in terms of tourism resources, most tourists still see the island as a tropical getaway, focusing on \u201cgreen\u201d tourism rather than hitting the mall.

It\u2019s the difference between thinking about something and actually doing it. So I had been thinking about it for a long time but never actually had the courage to do it because reading Psychology and Anthropology at [University], my studies had nothing to do with design. It took a little while to push myself to go ahead and do it, but I really enjoy it.", "JD: Your sunglasses are designed in England and manufactured in Europe, so as you\u2019re getting more into the China market, has that been an advantage business-wise? That kind of Europe/UK pedigree?", "FW: Yes, I guess that is an aspect people quite like about the brand, the fact that it\u2019s made in Britain, really like a British good. The reason I actually started doing it is because it\u2019s local, and also for me, there\u2019s really not that many factories that do these things by hand. Most of the glasses and eyewear nowadays is all injection-molded and mass-produced and manufactured outside Europe. So it\u2019s actually quite rare to find something that is actually hand-made \u2014 and I like things that are hand-made by people. It\u2019s one of the reasons that it\u2019s actually done in Europe because it\u2019s local to me: I can always go to the manufacturers, to talk about design, to work together really.", "And that, luckily, is one of the bonuses. People in Japan and China love British-made goods. It has worked to my advantage, I guess.", "JD: In terms of marketing your product, what\u2019s been your most successful marketing technique so far? ", "FW: Word of mouth, really. The cheapest and most effective marketing so far. Because I\u2019m based in the UK, and apart from the UK, most of my customers are based in the US and Japan and Southeast Asia, so it\u2019s all remote. [Many] people go online and search for \u201csunglasses, Asian sizes\u201d and word spread as people bought my sunglasses and liked them, then told their friends.", "I was lucky that I also went to Japan a few times through British Fashion Export, so we went to Japan and did trade shows and that was quite effective. I really like what I do. We haven\u2019t actually done too much marketing abroad, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on this year and hopefully in coming years.", "\u00a0", "Fei Wang Peony, \u00a3205 / $350 (2286 RMB)", "JD:\u00a0You said your biggest success so far has been in the US and Japan and Southeast Asia. In those markets, which one has been your top single market so far?", "FW: I would say Japan. [In] Japan I\u2019ve got solid clientele, boutiques. US is my biggest online market. In the US, most of the customers I have are individual customers. It\u2019s quite popular especially in LA, Orange County, and New York. That\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing. We went to the States last year, just to really try to introduce the brand properly there. We got quite a bit of interest from the shops and distributors that we\u2019re negotiating with, so hopefully!", "JD:\u00a0To go back to your marketing strategy, you said that most customers right now find you based on word of mouth. I was wondering what kind of new marketing strategies you\u2019re considering. ", "FW: In London, last week, I actually had a meeting with a marketing company. But for me, my strategy will be just to grow organically. I\u2019m more interested in having a gradual sort of market strategy to get press exposure and to get distributors staged and maybe do a few launches in big cities, like Tokyo, New York, LA, Beijing, and Shanghai.", "JD: In terms of that, what\u2019s the timeline for that kind of expansion? Last year you visited the US, and you\u2019re pretty established in Japan now. What\u2019s your timeline for expanding more heavily into the China market, say Beijing or Shanghai?", "FW: China is a tough market, but it\u2019s the biggest market as well. I think the confidence level of Chinese consumers has grown as well over the last few years. So you do see a trend, especially when I went to Shanghai, of consumers slowly moving away from just big brands and designer brands and taking an interest in smaller designers, independent designers, and new designers as well. That will be quite an interesting trend to watch, so Shanghai will definitely be my first approach in mainland China.", "It\u2019s interesting to see people [in China] spending money on things that actually have been hand-made rather than just going to Louis Vuitton or Chanel. It\u2019s quite encouraging for smaller designers like myself. Hopefully, this year and next year, we\u2019ll do some launches in shops and collaborations with boutiques.", "\u00a0", ".", "JD: In looking at a China expansion strategy, are you worried about people trying to copy your designs, or is that not really on your radar right now?", "FW: Lots of people ask me about that but I think [when] people want to copy your designs, sometimes it\u2019s quite a good thing, it\u2019s something worth copying. Otherwise, it\u2019s quite encouraging: \u201cOh, people actually copying my design, it must be good!\u201d I mean, those things you just can\u2019t avoid, unfortunately. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you protect yourself. But the customers that I want are not customers who really go on the street and buy fakes for ten dollars. It\u2019s people who really want to spend money on design, the actual quality of the glasses, and the concept behind the brand. So yeah, I\u2019m not really too worried, but you know, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll really have to think about in the future, I guess.", "JD: You said you\u2019ve got your sights set on Beijing and Shanghai, but what about other markets like Hong Kong? Would you consider Hong Kong an easier market, or a harder market to enter? ", "FW: Hong Kong is probably an easier market. I\u2019m already talking to shops in Hong Kong, as well as South Korea. I think style and fashion-wise, they\u2019re a little ahead of mainland China. But you know, Shanghai and Beijing, big cities in mainland China, are catching up very quickly. Hong Kong, for me personally, will definitely be slightly easier to do business and expand in.", "JD: Brands like Chanel and Dior are so dominant in the sunglasses market in China. You\u2019ve said that you\u2019re looking for a more sophisticated consumer who wants to buy new designers, but how else do you plan on competing with these big companies in China? Is it word of mouth again? Or do you have some other plans?", "FW: I\u2019m actually not really thinking about competing with them. I think the market they\u2019re targeting and the sort of consumer I\u2019m targeting is slightly different. I can\u2019t compete with the bigger companies with big financial backing and proper adverts and advertising campaigns. For me, my brand is an independent, small brand, and it\u2019s mainly eyewear, and the quality of the glasses and how they\u2019re made are different. For me, it\u2019s more of a personal relationship that I have, this method of individual customers, buyers, or boutiques. This is a quirky, little brand, but maybe when the brand gets to a certain stage, I\u2019ll have to think about competing with bigger brands like Chanel.", "JD: For the China market, would you consider your target consumer to be the same in the Japanese market? In terms of age or profession? How do you break down your target consumer?", "FW: In Japan, [my customers] are mostly in their early 20s up to their 40s or 50s. It really depends. Some of the designs I have are quite timeless, classic and sophisticated. There are other designs that I carry that are slightly quirky and bit mad, so attractive to a younger generation and people who like quirky and interesting designs and don\u2019t mind actually going on the street wearing mad designs. It\u2019s slightly different, my designs are quite wide-ranging. In Japan, it sells to a quite younger generation to 40s and 50s. In China, I\u2019m anticipating it will be the same, sort of, the young and stylish generation.", "But eyewear is interesting because it\u2019s not like clothing or shoes. It\u2019s really what personality you have. Maybe people in their mid 40s or 50s can still get away with wearing some bright color shades, or big frames, so it really depends on people\u2019s tastes.", "Fei Wang Hollywood, \u00a3205 / $350 (2286 RMB)", "JD: What\u2019s your most popular design? Do you have one single one that you just find is the one everyone wants? ", "FW: There are a couple of designs that seem to be selling very well. One of them is called the \u201cHollywood\u201d \u2014 maybe the name is attractive. The other one is \u201cPeony.\u201d Those two shades are my most popular designs.", "JD: And those are kind of classic designs?", "FW: Yes, quite classic, with round edges. I guess it\u2019s a bit soft, quite feline shaped and soft. Some girls don\u2019t really like square frames, or really round frames, so those are the two frames that are kind of in-between. Very classic.", "JD: It seems that the Word-of-Mouth marketing plan you\u2019ve got has worked very well for some companies in China.", "FW: Yeah, especially with the Internet and social networks. I think it\u2019s very powerful. I would say that people trust their friends and people that they know when they suggest, \u201cYou should go on this site, you should see her glasses.\u201d You trust them, instead of people always being worried when they see television adverts and [the product] looks too good to be true. So for me, word of mouth is has been very good, and it\u2019s actually a really good marketing strategy for smaller brands.", "JD: We\u2019re really fascinated with your company because we\u2019ve been closely watching the increasing sophistication of consumers in the biggest cities in China, how many of them are not just plastering themselves in logos anymore.", "FW: Absolutely, and in China it\u2019s such a huge population. It\u2019s not even just in China, but in the whole world, you are seeing people react against over-produced and over-manufactured things. They want something that is special, they want something that they know that not that many people out there are wearing.", "So it\u2019s always about individuality, and it\u2019s very good to see that craftsmanship and hand-made things are coming back into fashion.", "Special thanks to Fei Wang for taking the time to speak to Jing Daily.

With the ensuing increase in the number of wealthy residents, major luxury brands have begun to stream in, and the city now boasts two Louis Vuitton boutiques, a Gucci store, and brands like Tiffany & Co., Bally and Zegna concentrated at the high-end Charter Shopping Center (\u5353\u5c55\u8d2d\u7269\u4e2d\u5fc3). But interestingly enough, one factor that sets Shenyang apart from other fast-growing second-tier cities is its increasingly sophisticated second-hand luxury market. With Shenyang surpassing Hangzhou last year to become the third largest single luxury market in China with sales\u00a0totaling\u00a01.5 billion yuan (US$229 million), putting it behind only Beijing and Shanghai, a flood of high-end goods have washed over the city. Now, with demand surging, some enterprising luxury consumers have realized they can quickly turn a profit on their new luxury goods by \u201cflipping\u201d them at second-hand shops.", "From Sina (translation by Jing Daily team):", "No one knows exactly how many people are buying second-hand luxury goods in Shenyang, but anyone who joins this group of buyers quickly becomes a loyal fan. Recently, [shopping mall] Shenyang Secoo held a four-day second-hand luxury exhibition, only sending the exact date and time of the event to club members right before it began. The event ultimately pulled in 240,000 yuan (US$37,000). Explained manager Mr. Liu, Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market has a great deal of potential. One month earlier, a similar event made more than 100,000 yuan, but this comparatively large event was not only a financial success but also proved extremely popular among Shenyang shoppers.", "Last December, after noting the potential for the future development of Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market, manager Liu decided to start a consignment business. Liu decided to keep the store location quiet and decorate it in a low-key fashion, explaining, \u201c[my] business is second-hand luxury goods, not grandstanding. We want customers to be attracted by the goods themselves.\u201d Added Liu, \u201cIn the store, every item has ample space, which allows customers to clearly see the price of each product.\u201d The 200 square meter store has already attracted many shoppers, and interested parties can first check out the inventory online before coming in to inspect the items in person. Simple and convenient.", "The success of the recent Secoo luxury exhibition heartened second-hand luxury shop owners", "According to manager Liu, the most popular brands in Shenyang are Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Chanel, Coach, Hermes and Dior, with the most frequent transactions involving handbags, watches, sunglasses, jewelry, and scarves. Far and away, the most popular items are women\u2019s handbags. The consumer base is predominantly female, with Liu saying that female shoppers comprise more than 70 percent of shoppers at his store. Most of Liu\u2019s customers are independent business owners, housewives, or white collar workers between the ages of 30-40. As most of these individuals socialize with a similarly high-income, luxury-obsessed crowd, Liu sees no shortage of potential demand for second-hand goods.", "The Sina article goes on to note that the rapid development of Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market may boil down to the fact that some of the top luxury brands and most popular handbags are extremely hard to come by in Shenyang, with people there often having to sign up on long\u00a0wait-lists\u00a0for Hermes bags in other cities. Currently, there are more than 20 high-end consignment shops in Shenyang, most of which are centered in the city\u2019s Huanggu (\u7687\u59d1), Xitie (\u94c1\u897f) and\u00a0Hunnan (\u6d51\u5357) neighborhoods, or near the Charter Shopping Center.

According to manager Liu\u2019s rough estimate, last year Shenyang\u2019s 20 second-hand luxury shops saw turnover of more than 10 million yuan (US$1.5 million), making it, in Liu\u2019s estimation, the undisputed second-hand luxury hub of northeastern China.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Second-Tier Spotlight: Xi\u2019an\u2019s Young Luxury Consumers", "meta": "April 8, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Xi\u2019an\u2019s Zhongda International Shopping Mall", "It might not be as cosmopolitan as Shanghai or as culturally relevant as Beijing, but Xi\u2019an, capital city of Shaanxi Province and former seat of power to several imperial dynasties, is rapidly becoming an important second-tier destination for major luxury brands.

In terms of age, most luxury consumers range in age either from 28-35 or over the age of 40.

As a salesperson from one Italian womenswear brand told me, young shoppers now account for 25 percent of her sales. As I interviewed her, in rapid succession I noticed two shoppers around the age of 20 buying cosmetics at the nearby Dior cosmetics counter.", "While sales staff is bullish, it bears noting that major brands will have to take a long view in a city like Xi\u2019an, where spending power is growing but consumer education remains far lower than in cities like Shanghai or even Qingdao.

The article also quoted a consumer saying that,\u201dwe know there are plenty of fake Louis Vuittons [in China], but it makes me want to buy a real one even more, because being to be found out [to be carrying a fake] would be\u00a0embarrassing.\u201d", "Another consumer said, \u201cif [Louis Vuitton] didn\u2019t raise prices, they wouldn\u2019t highlight the power of their products, and if they didn\u2019t raise prices, I wouldn\u2019t buy from them.\u201d This seems to reflect the sentiments of many consumers surveyed by Sina, as year-on-year price increases for luxury goods have become something of an accepted rule.

Although domestic shopping still makes up less than 50% of luxury spending among Chinese consumers (44%, to be exact), the study notes that this is changing as more brands have focused on providing latest collections in the mainland market, including lower-ticket items in mainland inventories, and reducing operating margins to offset the tax difference. Going on, Bain identifies five main reasons Chinese shoppers will choose to shop locally rather than overseas: a desire to be perceived as a \u201cVIP,\u201d a better shopping experience, better size availability, access to service after sales, and impulse. As expected, the two main reasons Chinese shoppers will purchase luxury items overseas remain lower prices and a broader product selection.", "Another interesting finding is the growing importance of the Internet as an information source. Bain found that 60% of potential shoppers get their information about luxury goods online \u2014 up from only around 25% in 2006 \u2014 which makes the Internet the second most popular source of information after magazines (72%).

As the recent ArtTactic survey found, the primary driver for the Chinese contemporary art market going forward will be economic growth. Although there are signs that GDP growth in China is cooling, it\u2019s still expected to maintain a comparatively high growth rate, and other issues like inflation \u2014 rather than making Chinese art collectors shy away \u2014 should actually spur them to diversify their investments into more art and antiquities in coming years.", "As such, it\u2019s not that hard to understand what drives Chinese collectors to go far above high estimates for a Qianlong vase or a Liu Ye painting.

According to Zhang, if they are to compete with the dominant western luxury brands, Chinese luxury goods brands need to be bold enough to break with the prevailing fashion order and create and play by their own rules.", "Below is an interview with NE-TIGER\u2019s Zhang Zhifeng conducted at the conference:", "The media call you \u201cThe pioneer of the Chinese luxury brand industry\u201d. As the first person in China to establish a luxury brand enterprise, what are the major difficulties and challenges you have encountered over the past 2 decades? What kind of advice or suggestions could you give to your counterparts in the industry?", "I started my business in 1982 and founded the brand of NE.TIGER in 1992 \u2013 now it\u2019s been 28 years. For many years, I have been the first one in China to have built not only a luxury brand but also a guideline or a theory in the field as well as to have put it into practice. Meanwhile, I have been sharing my experience with my counterparts in the industry. As a Chinese proverb says, \u201cIt takes a decade to sharpen a sword\u201d.", "In each of these passing decades, we have walked, along with our nation, a path from self-awakening to self-sufficiency, and from independence to prosperity. Accompanied by the peaceful emergence of the Chinese nation, we are now embracing with confidence a new era of renaissance and revitalization in Chinese luxury civilization: that is the revitalization of the ancient Chinese luxury civilization and the development of Chinese luxury brands.", "Since the birth of NE.TIGER, we have pursued a course of dedicated study and research into the history and the culture of the luxury goods both in the East and the West. During the process, we found it is evident that the history of luxury goods in China dates back a very long time, and we might even say that China once conquered the world with its luxury products. I give you three examples: the first, in 139 B.C., the Silk Road established by ZHANG QIAN during the Han Dynasty extended into Persia, brought fine and exquisite Chinese silks as far as the Roman Empire, the center of Europe of the time, which was regarded as the lead of fashion. The second example is dated 1800 years ago. China in the TANG dynasty was not only the political, economic, and cultural center of the world, but also the center of fashion, as we can see today from how ladies were dressed in ancient frescoes and stone sculptures, indicating the splendid and open culture of fashion in the TANG Dynasty. We can even find many of its reflections and influence in evening gowns nowadays.", "My last example: in the MING Dynasty, the years between 1405 to 1433, ZHENG HE, sent by the Chinese government, voyaged 7 times to the West with hundreds of boats full of Chinese silk, Yun brocade, jade, China, tea and other renowned Chinese luxury products given as gifts to the world where they went. It was the peak time of the \u2018Silk Road of the Sea\u2019. That not only showed the grace of a Chinese nation of courtesy but also illustrated how China contributed to the culture and tradition of the appreciation and the consumption of luxury goods in the west.", "NE-TIGER's designs are imbued with Chinese design and cultural elements", "Unfortunately, the Chinese feudal system restricted the birth of luxury brands as opposed to luxury products, and as a result of the lost opportunity of the industrial revolution it was only very recently that China started the development of luxury goods through building brands and enterprises.", "As far as our challenge and difficulty is concerned, through the 30 years since the beginning of the reform in China, like the sea opening itself to the inflow of hundreds of rivers, many foreign luxury brands have entered into the Chinese market rapidly. To their great satisfaction, all those brands have not only encountered in China the best opportunities they have ever seen for one century or two \u2013 since their birth in their own home markets \u2013 but also they have been granted privileged status and super-super-national treatment by Chinese, which never happened to them elsewhere. They come here to invade cities and to occupy the land, to grab the market and to pan for gold in our prosperity.", "Meanwhile, some high-end shopping malls and department stores in major Chinese cities, for the sake of their own short-term interest, are willing to open the doors and to bow down themselves in front of foreign luxury brands by offering many privileges. For instance, foreign brands are always offered considerable discounts, the best locations, extended rent exemptions for a couple of years, covering cost for store renovation of the openings, reduced fees, etc. \u2013 all of these contribute to their rapid expansion in China. I cite here an example of a well-known western luxury brand. In a famous commercial avenue in Beijing, within 300 meters, it opened 3 stores in the past 2 years, at nearly zero cost.", "However in contrast, most new-born Chinese luxury brands are not treated fairly here and have to operate under considerable restrictions. Moreover, in the markets where there is only market reform and no market openings such as in the US and in Europe, we experience actual discrimination. In spite of all these facts, we take pride in the passion, loyalty, recognition and support of our customers. We believe that as our brands grow such difficulties will be just temporary, and with the cultivation of our brands, we can transform the challenges that we face into opportunities.", "Chinese luxury brands have global vision and our major advantage is that we have our roots in our 5000-year civilization. However, it\u2019s not enough. We should apply our innovation on it, in order to give it a new life. The advice I would like to give to my counterparts is that, I think Chinese luxury brands should be bold enough to challenge and to overcome the established centers of influence, to establish new rules, and to create new leadership in the industry.", "The huge potential of the Chinese market has attracted more and more attention from global luxury brands. They are entering into the Chinese market with more and more Chinese elements (Such as Chanel holding its fashion show in Shanghai). Some even started to build their own Chinese brand (such as \u201cShang-Xia \u201d of Hermes) by hiring local Chinese designers. Compared with these experienced luxury brands, what kind of advantage do you have, to build up a Chinese luxury brand?", "Europe became the first tier for luxury goods consumption within one or two centuries. The US became the second tier for luxury goods consumption after the Second World War within 50 years as the biggest economic force in the world. In the recent 30 years, with a developed Japan and an emerging China, East Asia is nowadays the third tier for luxury goods consumption. Despite the global recession of luxury goods consumption, China has a yearly growth rate of 20% to 30%. Currently, the consumption of luxury goods in China occupies 25% of global consumption, surpassing the US and becoming the top second nation in luxury goods consumption. The Chinese market is attracting the world\u2019s attention.", "NE-TIGER", "The European brands which we are familiar with, such as Hermes or Louis Vuitton, have a brand history not more than 200 years, and Chanel, Dior, Armani, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana have a history less than 100 years. Today, in the context of the globalization of the economy and the integration of information technologies, as well as a prosperous luxury goods consumption market, China can take much less time in building its own luxury brands, demonstrating another legend to the world.", "Besides, based on the market potential of billions of population, based on China\u2019s 5000 years of civilization and its cultural heritage of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and based on the passion and creativity of the new Chinese generation of designers, I believe in our future in the Chinese luxury brand industry.", "Most foreign luxury brands mainly have their origins in a talented designer or craft person, by offering customers some products fulfilling the need of the time, with excellent quality. This is how their products got popular and got recognized as an icon of the brand in the luxury industry. For example, trench coats from Burberry and its Equestrian Knight label. Chanel dresses and double C label, shoes and scarves of Ferragamo and its G label, etc. However until today, there is not yet any Chinese designer who can lead such a kind of vogue in the world. How do you see this phenomenon?", "As time passed by, the expectation and demand of luxury goods consumers evolved. Nowadays, a noticeable LOGO on a luxury product is not enough to match with consumers\u2019 social identity and status. They are paying more attention to, not only outstanding manufacturing and excellent service, but also appealing philosophy, value, culture and lifestyle that a luxury brand implies. More and more brands have gone beyond their distinctive LOGOs or patterns, and started to seek fashionable, personalized and artistic design in their new products, in order to fulfill consumers\u2019 needs. To demonstrate the luxury in low-profile and to interpret a unique taste is the main trend of today\u2019s luxury brand industry.", "In the age of globalization, the fusion of cultures has reached a new level. And our design concept of \u201cCombination of the ancient and the modern, melting the East and the West\u201d is in the trend. Such as Hua Fu of NE.TIGER, which represents the national dress of China, has become a symbol for Chinese spirit. Hua Fu takes \u201ccourtesy\u201d as spirit, \u201cYun brocades\u201d as material, Chinese embroideries as techniques, Chinese national colors as body. It has characteristics to symbolize, to be classic, to reflect the fusion and compatibility of races & minorities and to represent modernity. Hua Fu is regarded as the inheritor of Chinese civilization and we hope that it carries and spreads Chinese luxury civilization to the places in world where it will lead a trend.", "In which industry do you think a world influential enterprise in the luxury brand industry will be born in China?", "China used to be the major manufacturer of the world garment industry, and now becomes a nation also full of creativity and design capacity. Some Chinese design can even lead the global trend. Globally speaking, the industry which has a higher chance of bringing a Chinese enterprise with the world leading luxury brands must be the fashion industry, such as Chinese haute couture, which carries and reflects the rich Chinese culture background.", "In 2006, I described my theory of \u201cthe renaissance and revitalization of the Chinese luxury brand industry\u201d, as well as my prospects for its bright future. Up to now, we passed through globally eye-catching events such as the Beijing Olympics, 60th anniversary of the P.R.C. and we are looking forward to the Shanghai Expo very soon.

In this article, the author discusses the short- to medium-term prospects for luxury in China with a number of industry experts, and finds that there are no easy routes for sustainable revenue in the Mainland market. As long as wealthier customers can find luxury products abroad at a cheaper price, or can pop over the border to Hong Kong or Macau for a quick day-trip, even the most exclusive luxury brands will have trouble cajoling these customers to shop locally.", "[D]espite the allure of these glamorous and expansive retail establishments, many anecdotal reports suggest that a significant proportion of Chinese shoppers don\u2019t use local malls as the primary outlet to buy luxury goods.

These retail centres are acting more as showcases for the brand, which are distinct from actual retail sales. So you\u2019ll find a lot of Chinese consumers will go into the Dior shop in Plaza 66 in Shanghai [for example] and they\u2019ll look at the merchandise that\u2019s in there. But because of the 30% luxury tax at the moment, their first luxury experience with the brand will actually be when they come to Hong Kong or Macau.\u201d", "As Lock suggests, the high price of luxury goods in China is the foremost hurdle. Between tariffs and value-added taxes, prices in China can be up to a third higher than in Hong Kong. Hence, a quick and cheap flight to Hong Kong can deliver more bang for their buck since travel visas are relatively easy to acquire for wealthy Chinese customers. For the hardcore luxury addict, Tokyo offers more luxury options than anywhere else in Asia, becoming an increasingly popular destination with visa restrictions now also reduced. McKinsey found in its \u201cComing of Age\u201d survey that the Chinese rarely justify their foreign purchases on price differential alone, as they also want access to the more expansive product selection in Hong Kong and Tokyo retail branches.", "But even if Hong Kong is driving away some sales from the mainland, boutiques in China do perform an important function within promotion and brand awareness, equally providing a critical communications channel for fostering sales abroad.", "Although this article is wide-ranging and incredibly informative, a fuller sense of the buying habits of second-tier, and even third-tier, cities would probably be necessary to get a better sense of where the Chinese luxury market is headed. Quoting an expert on luxury markets in emerging economies, the Luxury Society article noted that conspicuous consumption of flashy (or, some would say, gaudy) and expensive luxury items is a hallmark of societies with wide income disparity, and in China\u2019s growing urban areas this disparity is vast and, in some cases, growing.", "If this trend holds true, we should probably see a two-sided growth for luxury brands in second-tier cities, as more brands open boutiques or mall showrooms and income gaps yawn. Though both will, over time, slow down and probably reverse, for the medium- to long-term it looks like brands looking to build a real footprint in China and build real brand equity should look past the marquee cities in the east \u2014 or at least understand that these eastern cities are just going to function as living catalogues for the Chinese urban jet set."]}]
