As a newcomer to the market, which is populated by luxury watchmakers like Cartier, Longines, Piaget, Omega, Rolex, Hublot and others that have built reputations\u00a0in China over the last couple of decades, DeWitt will have to think creatively about how to catch the eyes of Chinese consumers.", "The brand\u2019s jaw-dropping, face-giving price tags \u2014 which range from the thousands of dollars to the hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 and Swiss heritage are two advantages in China\u2019s status-obsessed market, but in terms of brand promotion, DeWitt would be well suited to take a page from its competitors\u2019 playbooks.", "Having now set up shop in Hong Kong (perhaps the most popular luxury watch-buying destination for mainland Chinese tourist-shoppers), appointing a well-known Chinese brand ambassador \u2014 following the lead of\u00a0Hublot, Maurice Lacroix, TAG Heuer and Cyma \u2014 and localizing collections (or increasing inventory) that caters to the current Chinese preference for classic designs, thin profiles and diamond bezels, would be good next steps for DeWitt to take.", "Tweet", "Follow @JingDaily ", "", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", ""]}, {"title": "Why Digital Mastery is Needed to Survive COVID-19", "meta": "April 6, 2020", "paragraphs": ["Months ago, I spoke with one of the most luxurious food sellers about how to prepare for a digital future while creating a more persuasive purpose for the brand. In a rapidly changing world, the owners felt action was needed. Sales were flat, and the company wanted to start attracting more Gen Zers and young Millennials.\u00a0They had deficits in brand positioning and storytelling, which made it difficult for the brand to connect with younger audiences (its core demographic was primarily in their 40s and 50s). Like many brands, it was aware that it needed to move toward a digital transformation but preferred to focus on its physical stores.", "And then, when it was time to pull the trigger and implement some necessary measures, the brand postponed. The CEO gave me his reason, stating, \u201cOur brand was built over 50 years in a traditional way. We don\u2019t need to change at this point. We have time. We understand luxury. We will adjust when the right time comes.\u201d", "Sadly, the business completely crashed this month. The brand\u2019s restaurants and retail shops around the world closed. Since it passed on the opportunity to build a digital brand, create new brand communities, and engage with customers on social media, it went out of business in just three weeks. Fifty years of heritage evaporated in an instant because the brand chose not to prepare for the future when it could have. Instead of spending a fraction of its advertising budget on improving the brand\u2019s storytelling and digital footprint, it kept doing \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d when the market had already been wildly disrupted. Complacency \u2014 not the virus \u2014 killed the brand.", "Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve had many discussions with CEOs of brands in all categories about what to do during this moment. Brands that chose a wait-and-see approach to digital transformation in the past have now been left in the dark. If they are still in business, they don\u2019t know nearly enough about changing customer sentiments, since they lack digital, real-time, consumer-insight tools. Before this crisis, many companies thought of those tools as \u201cnice to have,\u201d not realizing they would soon be essential lifelines. As a result, they\u2019re unable to move quickly enough to engage with online consumers and compensate for their lost physical sales.", "Succeeding in the digital realm takes a lot more than just deploying a web store. I refer to it as \u201ccyber-luxury\u201d \u2014 the ability to create highly-engaging and relevant end-to-end digital experiences that closely connect to physical buying experiences. For most brands today, the purchase journey starts online. Recently, I reconfirmed with brand owners in all categories including luxury beauty, luxury fashion, high-end jewelry, and luxury cars that even before the COVID-19 crisis most consumers decided they were going to purchase from a brand before they even entered the store. Today, going into a store is just about confirming a purchase.", "What does this mean? It means that if consumers decide upon purchases\u00a0before\u00a0a store visit, a brand has to win them over digitally. And they have to address all aspects of the customer journey, including consumer sentiment changes, competitive dynamics, trending topics, concerns, and content. Brands that haven\u2019t prepared for the digital age \u2014 and that\u2019s most of them \u2014 will need to right now, or they risk not attracting consumers.", "But the need for digital agility isn\u2019t just limited to digital infrastructure. It starts with brand storytelling. Most brands still follow a style of positioning logic that was created before the dawn of digital media, one based on designs (logo, shape, features) and consumer awareness. This brand-building approach was relevant until about five years ago when recognition stopped being a decisive factor for driving growth.", "Since Gen Zers are now digitally influencing the buying behaviors of the other generations, a brand\u2019s main equity driver has become its purpose. Yet very few brands clearly or distinctly express their purpose. For example, after auditing a variety of luxury car brands, we found that most lacked a discernible purpose and clear storytelling. That was okay in the pre-digital age, but that\u2019s not acceptable to today\u2019s young and digitally-savvy customers. We found similar results in most luxury categories, including fashion, jewelry, beauty, and hospitality. They all lacked this precondition for success on digital channels.", "If a brand\u2019s digital interface is well-managed, it won\u2019t just weather the current storm but will also dramatically improve its competitiveness. There are always enormous opportunities for agile brands, even in traditional, physical sectors like luxury cars, fine watches, or jewelry. A crisis can become an opportunity when brands stay ahead of market changes using digital means to create extreme value. And the best part? It doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. Times of crisis call for smart investments with high ROI.", "I am often asked why a brand in a traditional market like luxury must lead digitally. I respond by saying that a luxury brand must always lead. Our research shows that the perception of luxury is dependent on how innovative and inspiring a brand appears to consumers, which includes its ability to create social currency with social media and influencers. A brand that doesn\u2019t master the digital realm won\u2019t be perceived as a leading luxury brand. It\u2019s as simple as that. I\u2019ve seen a brand become irrelevant in only three years once consumers decided it was no longer an industry leader. The ability to digitally inspire creates extreme value.", "That\u2019s why complacent or passive luxury brands lose during a time of crisis, or even worse, become obsolete. It\u2019s important to manage cash flow and keep operations running, but if it\u2019s done at the expense of connecting with customers, a brand won\u2019t survive. When life gradually returns to normal, the most innovative, agile, and creative brands will undoubtedly come out much stronger. Those are the digitally-savvy brands that create extreme value by empowering their employees to find outside-the-box solutions and relentlessly focus on their customers\u2019 needs.", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm\u00a0\u00c9quit\u00e9,\u00a0and the professor of luxury strategy and extreme value creation at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.

Second, this is not just a crisis of demand but also supply. Shelves are empty; supply chains have been interrupted; and stores, services, and restaurants are closed. This compounds our issues considerably. Lastly, this has been an extreme personal challenge for many because of social distancing, working and schooling from home, and the isolation of lockdowns.", "What makes matters worse for many brands is that we were already in a state of massive disruption before this crisis started. I dedicated many of my past Jing Daily columns to the need for brands to meet new market challenges. Millennials and Gen Zers are driving disruption, and many traditional brands already had difficulties communicating with those younger consumer groups. Massive technology shifts, digital business models, and rapidly changing consumer preferences were regularly upending the luxury industry before COVID-19. In fact, most of my projects over the last two years were focused on transforming brands so they can survive in this new reality. Even before the outbreak, it was clear that most brands couldn\u2019t just go on with business and usual.", "Still, many brands are struggling to stay relevant to younger customers because they don\u2019t have their value creation model defined precisely enough, are far behind in terms of digital capabilities, have their products priced incorrectly, and own retail spaces that aren\u2019t future-ready. Many brands still struggle with the term \u201cluxury\u201d \u2014 defining it solely as objects with a high price \u2014 but they forget that luxury is, first and foremost, about extreme value creation.", "But one thing should already be clear to brands because of this crisis: It will usher in what I call an era of \u201cdigital super-acceleration.\u201d Any gap in digital mastery will put luxury brands (or any other brand) at a strategic disadvantage.

To maintain the perception of luxury and create extreme value, brands must be influential and innovative.

Your team has to make decisions under pressure and uncertainty, so they must know they\u2019re protected, empowered, and valued.

If leaders increase fear by spreading uncertainty about the future or immediately cutting staff to save costs, then no one in the organization can take proper risks or be decisive thinkers. Doing that is putting the company\u2019s long-term outlook at risk on behalf of short-term profit.", "", "Similarly, now it is the time to show leadership with your customers, to support and nurture them, and to help them get through the crisis as a team. Any authentic or truthful effort that helps make a change in their lives during these unprecedented times creates enormous equity, and this is something you can build on in the future.

I believe this is true, and the word is often used far too loosely. Today, companies slap a high price tag on almost any type of product as a way to label it \u201cluxury.\u201d Yet this strategy almost always fails.", "At a recent conference on luxury beauty, one speaker showcased a luxury brand she launched about two years ago. When I asked what made the brand \u201cluxury,\u201d she replied that the packaging looks luxurious, the ingredients are amazing, and the formula performed extremely well. And, she added, the price is high. In short: Packaging, function, and price were the attributes that made a brand luxurious to her.", "This is what I call the luxury trap. It\u2019s a fatal mistake many brands make. Defining a luxury brand by its functional aspects and high prices cannot replace the value a brand creates.", "Thus, when people ask me about the best way to create a luxury brand, I talk to them about extreme value creation. Luxury brands have to create an extreme amount of value for their consumers. Design, packaging, and function are undoubtedly important features. However, they aren\u2019t what drive Added Luxury Value (ALV), and ALV is the precondition that\u2019s needed before someone will even consider buying a luxury brand.", "Brands must define extreme value creation first. Only then can they determine their prices. When pricing comes first, and the value proposition is unclear, brands will fail in the long run.", "Even in sophisticated product categories such as high-end mechanical watches or hypercars, high-tech products aren\u2019t extreme value drivers. A great brand story, followed by a consistently excellent execution of that story across all customer touchpoints, drives value. I often see brands try to mask a weak brand story by throwing money at celebrities or influencers in their advertising. But amplifying a weak story with multiple communication outlets doesn\u2019t make it stronger, it only makes things worse. Budgets are wasted, poor consumer connections are created, and the brand fails anyway.", "Instead, brands need to develop a much more critical view of themselves. They should start by asking questions \u2014 Who are we? Why are we doing what we\u2019re doing? What do we do differently than any other brand? Why/how are we creating value for consumers? What is our value creation model? It is surprising how few brands can answer these questions.", "Once those gaps are identified, brands can truthfully develop their brand story. It must be insight-driven, relevant, authentic, and differentiating. And these can\u2019t be faked. \u201cAuthentic\u201d means being completely real (95-percent authentic isn\u2019t enough.) Consumers, especially Gen Zers, identify weaknesses immediately and will walk away from inauthentic brands. In a time of so much digital noise, brand storytelling is much more important than ever before.", "The next step is to validate the story across the entire customer journey. This includes product attributes (including quality and craftsmanship), but those aren\u2019t enough. All online and offline touchpoints need to be mapped and optimized. If luxury doesn\u2019t create memories, it isn\u2019t creating value. In other words: If a brand doesn\u2019t manage the brand story and the customer journey, it can\u2019t create consumer value, never mind extreme value.

Therefore, brands that suffer early in a downturn usually have deeper, underlying issues. In other words, an external crisis is just a catalyst for underperformance and not the reason for it.", "The first step towards more clarity when a brand underperforms is to be brutally honest and look for the real reasons why it\u2019s behind expectations.

I often get reactions like, \u201cwe\u2019re not at a stage where we need that yet.\u201d But brand preferences are built online through influencers or social media and online conversations. So if a brand isn\u2019t able to understand which topics are trending, how consumers see the brand in a competitive context, and how their perceptions change over time, then the brand can\u2019t compete. It\u2019s that simple. Someone else will do a better job, and when they do, an underperforming brand\u2019s downward spiral will accelerate.", "For example, one of the most iconic fashion brands in the world used A.I.-powered social intelligence to understand how sustainability became more important in China, which affected sales in their most important market. The technology was not only able to show precisely how consumer preferences shifted but also what related topics were trending. This allowed the brand to improve its relevance and connect better with Millennials and Gen Zers.", "An audit revealed the brand\u2019s strengths but also significant gaps in its approach. What many brands underestimate is that those gaps usually aren\u2019t a result of poor product performance. In fact, a lot of underperforming brands have excellent products.

Product excellence and craftsmanship are important, but other factors are much more critical, and the most important aspect is the brand\u2019s story.", "For almost every brand, we identify significant gaps in its brand storytelling. They originate from a brand\u2019s vague positioning, which focuses too much on internal capabilities and category norms and not enough on differentiating the brand enough from its competitors. Differentiating through a product\u2019s features may be a winning strategy when selling a commodity, but in the luxury industry, it can destroy brand value if done incorrectly. Instead, luxury brands need to define what I call a \u201cunique performance point\u201d combined with a clear understanding of how the brand inspires its consumers.", "The combination of those two aspects \u2014 one rational and the other emotional \u2014 is the base of a strong brand story. It explains the brand\u2019s purpose, which needs to be relevant to consumers. They must understand why they should buy the brand and how it creates extreme value \u2014 especially larger and more traditional luxury brands that have a deficit of brand storytelling.", "Many brands are still built on a branding logic that was relevant maybe ten, twenty, or even thirty years ago when there was less competition, transparency, access, and choice. Brands could get away with simply having a famous name while building up their awareness and distribution channels. But today is a completely different time, and the \u201cgood old times\u201d will never come back. I like to say that \u201cthe only easy day was yesterday.\u201d Competition in all categories will continue to increase dramatically, market entry barriers will keep lowering, digital disruption will further accelerate, and consumers will become savvier and more demanding. If a brand does not have a relevant purpose and isn\u2019t authentic, Millennials and Gen Zers will turn away.", "This is why a regular audit is critical, and identified gaps need to get fixed with fast and precise countermeasures. If a brand story is weak, it must be addressed immediately before competitors take advantage or consumers opt out of a category entirely. The speed of change can be dramatic. One fashion brand I spoke with had lost 30 percent of its young consumers over the past calendar year. The CEO couldn\u2019t believe how fast change hit him. Without drastic measures, the brand wouldn\u2019t be able to turn things around.", "To turn a brand around, managers need to think beyond products and advertising, especially the latter, which might even accelerate a brand\u2019s decline if its story isn\u2019t relevant. Millions of dollars are often wasted accelerating a brand\u2019s downfall rather than helping the brand to achieve its goals. Another critical point that brands often ignore is mapping the whole customer experience across every sales touchpoint. Only when the experience at each touchpoint is strengthening the brand story can a brand be competitive. Even one \u201cred flag\u201d is enough to tank a brand\u2019s entire perception.", "Brand storytelling is a holistic task. It starts with understanding what your brand really stands for and then rigorously applying that story along the brand\u2019s entire customer journey \u2014 without exception. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s the biggest deficit of underperforming brands. Without addressing this core issue, brands are just \u201cputting lipstick on a pig\u201d by taking other measures.

Second, most established luxury brand CEOs all have the same problem in that they only appeal to customers over 40 while struggling to connect with young millennial or Gen-Z consumers.

Even leading brands and seasoned managers fall into the same trap over and over: pricing based on cost and competitors. Because of this, we see a lot of untapped optimization potential in luxury pricing. Many luxury brands are not profitable enough because they make pricing mistakes. But what\u2019s even worse is when their incorrect pricing erodes hard-won luxury positioning with customers. When luxury brands fail and disappear from the market, incorrect pricing is often to blame. It surprises many to learn that many luxury brands are priced too low thanks to bad internal strategies.", "The easy growth trap", "One common mistake a brand makes is trying to stimulate growth with entry-level pricing. The pattern typically goes like this: A brand is launched with sharp luxury positioning and items that are identified by customers as luxury products. It goes on to achieve high brand loyalty and a strong connection with customers who have come to worship the brand\u2019s iconic items. Unit profitability is high, and the units are kept low. But to grow, the brand decides to launch additional lines at lower price points. For a car brand, that can look like a more accessible SUV (a typical move of many luxury car brands in the mold of Porsche\u2019s Cayenne) and for a luxury fashion brand, it might be a sportier, more affordable line of clothing.", "If this type of extension is consistent with the brand\u2019s core positioning, this strategy could work, but most entry-level extensions fail over time and destroy brand equity and customer value in the process. When line extensions are not congruent with the brand\u2019s storytelling and compromise on luxury, they become interchangeable. Once this happens, the brand\u2019s loyal consumers will turn away from the brand\u2019s high-priced top items, and later, their new, lower-income customers will turn away from the cheaper items. There are many examples of failed entry-level strategies that go on to weaken a brand\u2019s core.", "A luxury car brand that sells the majority of their cars at price points above $500,000 recently introduced a cheaper, two-door sports car. The initial reception was overwhelming, and the brand extended its sales by more than ten times the original rollout. The move was celebrated as a success. However, the company\u2019s CEO confessed to me that after the release of this car, sales of the brand\u2019s most profitable, top-end vehicles collapsed. Those who had bought the car brand for its air of exclusivity quickly deserted it. According to the CEO, a driver of the top-end model told him that he would never \u201cdrive the same car my dentist drives.\u201d Today, the brand is losing money and selling fewer units, and they recently had to lay off a significant amount of staff.", "To tell a great story, brands need to define an extreme performance point.", "Meanwhile, a luxury fashion brand decided to launch a more accessible, denim-inspired collection and an even more accessible streetwear collection. While the initial growth was explosive, profits eventually collapsed. Now, hardly any customers are buying the top-end line. The brand quickly transformed itself from a luxury leader to a struggling, undefined brand that has an uncertain future.", "Building an incongruent portfolio is a major pitfall when chasing an easy growth trap. Everything looks great for 3-5 years until a sudden awakening comes. And when this happens, it\u2019s already too late to fix because the brand has lost its cachet and exclusivity with consumers. Only the most drastic corrections have the possibility of helping.", "The cost-based pricing trap", "Another typical mistake I see is pricing according to cost. Many luxury brands simply add the cost of items to the desired profit margin and cross-check with the competition\u2019s pricing to set their prices. Alas, nothing could be more wrong.", "In luxury, the core task for a brand is to provide \u201cadded luxury value\u201d (ALV), which is a value that\u2019s based on several social-status effects. Some of those effects are intuitive (signaling social dominance, luxury as an ultimate treat) while others are more hidden (public protection, signaling expertise, or promising enhanced attractiveness). Perceived ALV is what people pay a very high price for \u2014 not a product\u2019s features. This is a critical distinction. ALV is driven by the brand\u2019s story rather than the product. When brands set their values based on cost and margin expectations, they almost always mistakenly price too low, signaling a lack of ALV. This confuses consumers and they won\u2019t buy the brand.", "A great example of this is an omelet that\u2019s sold in a New York hotel. It\u2019s known as the most expensive omelet in the world, with a price that\u2019s been set at $1,000 for over a decade. And yet, after studying the omelet\u2019s price with a luxury pricing algorithm, we concluded that the price was by far too low \u2014 even though that seems counterintuitive. I suggested to the restaurant that could sell the omelet for at least double the price and then published a case study about it. Nothing changed for years \u2014 that is until the price of caviar increased, and the hotel restaurant raised the price of the omelet to $2,000 dollars. Now, according to press releases, demand for the omelet has increased significantly. Although the caviar price hike forced the restaurant to correct the omelet price, they could\u2019ve sold the omelet a decade earlier at a price that reflects its real ALV.", "Brand storytelling and pricing", "ALV is driven by the brand and its story. To tell a great story, brands need to define an extreme performance point \u2014 in other words, one element that they do better than anyone else. This is rarely product-related and is more often brand-related, typically touching some deeply-ingrained consumer needs.", "When brand storytelling is weak, no ALV is created, so the ability to price is negatively impacted. Unlike mass-market products, luxury pricing should reflect the brand\u2019s ALV instead of the product\u2019s features. Basing price on features is one of the deadliest mistakes a luxury brand can make.", "When done correctly and deployed with smart strategies like limited editions, proper pricing offers great potential for luxury brands to become even more profitable and build greater brand equity over time.

However, a product in this extreme pricing tier will only be successful if the value it creates matches the price. As such, the price is a result of value creation \u2014 not the value itself. Therefore, to create luxury, brands need to create value. But what drives this value? And why do people buy luxuries?", "Most people I talk to, even seasoned managers, answer intuitively with \u201csocial status.\u201d Social status is surely a part of a luxury brand\u2019s value, but the overall value is so much more than that. This is critical for luxury brands to understand: The product and its qualities (design, features, materials, craftsmanship) don\u2019t create luxury value. The product merely signifies \u201cluxury\u201d to the public (or it doesn\u2019t).", "Once people perceive a brand as a luxury, effects kick in that drive its product\u2019s value in a nonlinear way.

In the luxury context, a woman was driving in a Bentley convertible and a man was wearing a Patek Philippe watch. In the non-luxury context, the same woman was driving a Volkswagen and the same man was wearing a Swatch. The study was such that the participants didn\u2019t know the topic was luxury, but instead, they thought it was a general psychological survey. They were asked their personal views about the people in these contexts, and a single participant either evaluated the first or the second situation exclusively without knowing the other context existed.", "The stunning results showed us that physical beauty and attractiveness are not absolute evaluations, but rather, they depend on context. The Bentley and the Patek made their owners seem significantly more attractive, desired, and beautiful to evaluators than the same owners wearing non-luxury products. After the participants answered all the questions, we asked them if they would ever be influenced in their evaluation by luxury. Whether or not people verbally stated that luxury products influenced them, the results were consistent. This indicates that people have a high sensitivity to this hidden effect, regardless of their views on luxury. In other words, people subconsciously ascribe enhanced attractiveness to luxury, and that expected attractiveness drives the value of luxury products significantly.", "The expectation of perceived expertise is also an important driver of luxury value.", "Hidden aspect #2: expert signals", "Participants in this study also attributed a greater amount of \u201cexpertise\u201d to the people who were pictured using luxury brands, as compared to those people shown using non-luxury brands. The luxury context triggered a conviction that people with luxuries knew a considerable amount of information about many things, making them seem like experts.

This sense of public protection is highly desired and drives luxury value in a nonlinear fashion.", "Hidden aspect #4: mindset shift towards new experiences", "Participants assumed that the people pictured using luxury products were having a lot of fun and experiencing spectacular or unusual things. In other words, luxury can create a mindset that allows people to try new experiences and break out of their common patterns and usual routines. The desire for exceptional experiences is also a critical driver of luxury value and should not be underestimated.", "Why brands should care", "When uncovered, these four hidden drivers can offer brands significant opportunities to create value. People anticipate those aspects from luxury, so the more brands center their storytelling around these subconscious desires, the more they will be able to create a relevant brand proposition.", "When we analyzed luxury, lifestyle, and consumer brands, it became obvious that a brand\u2019s storytelling directly correlated with its market success. Brands that project who they are with clarity \u2014 not just on paper but through the superiority of their daily execution \u2014 have a drastically higher chance of successfully connecting with their customers, while brands that aren\u2019t clear usually fail.

If it fails in even just one dimension, the allure of the brand is shattered.", "One of the most underestimated dimensions in luxury is experience creation. Many brands fail to keep up with today\u2019s rapidly changing expectations for extraordinary experiences. This may be surprising because, after all, isn\u2019t luxury primarily about experiences? Indeed, luxury managers often passionately describe their brands by saying \u201cwe create dreams\u201d or \u201cwe are in the business of making dreams come true.\u201d Yet the issue is that the brand\u2019s internal dream often doesn\u2019t match the customer\u2019s external dream.", "We live in a time of rapid change. Luxury customers have come to expect the highest quality, the finest materials, and the greatest savoir-faire from every luxury brand, and if it\u2019s not up to their expectations, they quickly move on. But once they\u2019ve experienced something good, it becomes their new benchmark, and the next time they buy a luxury item, the new benchmark is \u201cpriced in.\u201d In other words, the new level of value becomes expected. If craftsmanship is missing, people will not buy a luxury brand. What was extraordinary even two years ago is not enough to be successful today. The stakes get higher and higher, expectations multiply, and companies must change accordingly. It\u2019s a rapidly-evolving game where those who stand still become obsolete.", "How customers experience the shopping process, how personalized their treatment is, and how special they feel is now equally important to the product.", "This paradigm shift comes from customers all over the world, however, it is young, urban Chinese customers who are disrupting luxury the most. The youngest customers now have the highest expectations toward luxury brands, yet many traditional brands still underestimate them. I meet a lot of managers who tell me customers under 40 do not have the buying power for their luxury brands. Yet the numbers contradict them: In China, more than 80 percent of luxury goods are bought by consumers under 40, including a rapidly increasing share of Gen Zers, who are all 20 years old or younger. If the majority of consumption is in that age bracket, no brand can afford to ignore their preferences or expectations.", "And in China, the expectations of extraordinary experiences for these consumers are heightening at a rapid pace. Take the case of a young female office worker in Shanghai I know who has a monthly income equaling roughly $3,000. She recently went on a trip to Paris and wanted advice on where to spend three unforgettable days. She said her budget was $2,000 per day for a hotel, and she wanted to get the best possible experience. She even stated that she would make the trip shorter and pay 50 percent more if it meant a significantly better experience. This is quite a different mindset from traditional travelers who would spend less on a hotel so they could extend their stay, even at a middle-class income level. For many, the quality of experience has become more important than anything else.", "This is true in every luxury category. Wellness, for example, has become a big luxury trend in China. Now, top-end customers not only expect personal trainers for their sessions, they even demand the entire gym for themselves so they can have the most individualized experience possible. Shopping for a handbag has become that kind of experience. How customers experience the shopping process, how personalized their treatment is, and how special they feel is now equally important to the product. Many of these customers now expect luxury brands to have an internal personal shopper who excites them with behind-the-scenes information, collection previews, and a curated selection of relevant new items. Total personalization has become the ultimate luxury, and this requires knowing the needs and expectations of your customers in-depth. In Japan, for instance, there is a service that allows customers to rent a luxury sneaker by the hour, so they can take a picture in them for their social media postings. That\u2019s how important experiences are today.", "But the issue of providing a once-in-a-lifetime experience is that it no longer surprises the consumer after the first experience. Hence, luxury brands have to constantly create new experiences to stay relevant. The ability to influence, innovate, and inspire becomes a significant factor for successful luxury brands. Yet, many luxury brands do not have an established process for creating innovative experiences. Very few brands have Chief Experience Officers who are responsible for ensuring that their brands surprise and wow their customers again and again.", "And most brands don\u2019t even understand that these rapidly changing expectations exist. That\u2019s why for larger luxury brands, relying on simple social media listening tools or classic market research isn\u2019t enough to help them win over consumers. In other words: It\u2019s a recipe for failure. Systematic consumer data collection and the scanning of social media conversations of customers using highly sophisticated data querying technologies aren\u2019t optional tools anymore \u2014 they are must-haves for any luxury brand in today\u2019s competitive market.", "The changes are real, and the old days won\u2019t ever come back. Luxury brands need to refocus on delivering customer value, not just products. Fine materials and great services are expected. Those who win can make the experience \u201cbranded\u201d\u2014 very distinct and different from any other brand \u2014 not just in terms of aesthetics but also the emotions they can make their clients feel. This is why rational and emotional clarity about the core values of the brand is indispensable. The brand\u2019s purpose needs to be defined and understood by everyone in the organization, the customer journey must be detailed meticulously, and the staff must be trained on their roles in delivering the company\u2019s branded experience.", "Luxury will always be about extreme value creation. It\u2019s pure emotion that features the highest end of artistry and excellent storytelling. It must lead to an unexpected experience that\u2019s always surprising, never entirely predictable, and always exciting.

On the flipside, its intangible nature leads to an immediate collapse of ALV when a brand makes a mistake.", "Unfortunately, in luxury, branding mistakes are plentiful. After a recent meeting with the top management team of a well-known luxury brand in China, I asked them about what keeps them up at night. They said that \u201calmost all brands do exactly the same thing.\u201d In short, that there was not enough differentiation. This confession is remarkable because luxury is by definition extreme value creation. And in my experience, extreme value can only be created and maintained if a brand has distinct brand properties. If a brand is exchangeable, then it does not create a defendable extreme value. High price points and customer love won\u2019t be sustainable. I see this in a lot of my brand audits \u2014 the need for luxury brands to become much more distinct, differentiated, and relevant.", "Perception is not reality, especially internal perception. This is another important pitfall. We have conducted a series of perception mappings for our clients using sophisticated AI-supported social media listening and consumer sentiment measurement methods, practically always producing shocking results: managers see how their perception of their own brands is flawed. Because management teams of brands are very close to its core positioning, they often take for granted that consumers see the brand in the same way they do. In many cases, especially in China, they are wrong. To make matters worse, most brands underinvest in real-time data-driven consumer insight tools. And the moment they realize that their internal perception is not reality, it\u2019s probably too late. They\u2019ve lost valuable time and millions of dollars in lost profits. As a result, very few luxury brands are profitable in China. Underestimating consumers, brand perception shortcomings, gaps in communication content, and competition can prove to be deadly.", "Another common mistake is not perfectly executing the consumer journey. Most brands plan for the best case, few have contingencies in place on how to build brand equity when things go wrong. A week ago, I had to fly from Hong Kong via Shanghai to Los Angeles. I booked the flight in Delta One, a first-class cabin, which Delta priced for accordingly. Due to bad weather, I missed my connection to Los Angeles, which happened to be the last flight out to the U.S. that day. Any experienced traveler understands that flight delays are part of the travel experience, but after many lost hours at the airport trying to rebook my connecting flight, the airline finally dropped me off at an airport for the night. And that\u2019s when my trip slid into a horror show. The hotel was in the middle of nowhere with a defunct air-condition, a dirty bed, and not even a bottle of water was offered, nor were any Western credit cards accepted. As a result, what should have been a very pleasant first-class luxury experience with a culinary selection in the sky and proactive, helpful staff, ended in a complete disaster, not wanting me to ever board a Delta plane again.", "Don\u2019t get it wrong. This experience happens all the time across all brands and categories. A dish improperly plated and served in a Michelin-star restaurant, a sales person in a luxury fashion store who\u2019s having a bad day and is snappy at the customer, a front-desk staff who wrongly tells the person wanting to check-in at a luxury hotel that he forgot to make a reservation to the service manager in a Lamborghini car dealership to have a loaner car ready when the client brings in her car. The list goes on and on and on. In luxury, every-touch point counts. Every negative interaction can make ALV collapse, even if the interaction initially seems small. Luxuries are not normal products! They\u2019re the ones creating the highest perceived consumer value, and when things go wrong, they feel cheated. And rightly so!", "Managers of luxury brands need to rethink their approach. Starting with a rigorous assessment of how well-positioned and differentiated their brand is. Because (internal) perception is not reality, this should be done utilizing data-driven insight tools. If the brand is not strong enough, it must be repositioned and strengthened. I hear too often from Chinese teams of global luxury brands, \u201cWe can\u2019t change anything, the brand is defined in Italy (or France, or the U.S.).\u201d Good luck with that. If there are gaps, they need to be addressed! Competition is too strong; consumers too impatient and weak brands will not survive (or only survive as halo brands that produce huge losses). Lastly, the customer journey needs to be scrutinized, audited, and optimized, so that what happened to me on my flight hopefully happens to no one else. Luxury is not just an excellent customer journey. It\u2019s something that has to be maximally differentiated from the journeys of all competitors, so that a customer bonds emotionally with the brand. And finally, if branding is dependent just on logos, colors and uniforms, then it\u2019s not enough.

A European browser search of the phrase \u201ccounterfeits on Alibaba\u201d returns over 600 results, for instance, while \u201ccounterfeits on Pinduoduo\u201d offers less than 200 \u2014 hardly an accurate reflection of the problems inherent to both platforms.", "Although Alibaba and JD continue to dominate China\u2019s e-commerce landscape, it may surprise many to know that third place (second in some accounts) has been taken by the social commerce platform Pinduoduo. For those paying closer attention to Chinese markets, they will know that over the past three years, the Tencent-backed shopping app for discounted goods has seen incredible growth, but it also had a checkered history with counterfeit listings.", "When Pinduoduo debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2018, it was touted as China\u2019s fastest-growing business. But by August, it faced an investigation from the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) over its failure to challenge intellectual property infringements, and the company\u2019s stock had fallen. Pinduoduo had to act quickly. It claimed to have removed 1,128 stores and taken down 4.3 million listings from its site. But this one week of action was a band-aid for a much bigger problem, and in April 2019, the company was blacklisted for the first time as part of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report into \u201cnotorious markets.\u201d While Alibaba\u2019s Taobao website was also condemned for the third year running in the same USTR paper, the report did at least acknowledge that their group \u201chas taken some steps to curb the offer and sale of infringing products.\u201d", "The threat to brands\u2019 profits and reputations because of social shopping apps such as Pinduoduo, Little Red Book, WeChat\u2019s Weidian, and Taobao\u2019s Xianyu is real, but it\u2019s also just one part of a complex and evolving situation for luxury brands. Pinduoduo is well known as a platform for cheap goods and group discounts, and its growth has been fuelled by the mobile engagement and gamification technologies that are aimed at its reported 77.5 million daily users from the poorer regions of provincial China. Therefore, while it might seem as if the company, known as \u201cChina\u2019s Groupon,\u201d poses a lesser threat for high-end fashion and lifestyle brands, there are actually several reasons why it deserves closer scrutiny.", "China cares about social commerce", "Regardless of its current consumer demographics, China\u2019s embrace of social shopping is growing. Apps like Pinduoduo encourage users to create profiles and then generate their own content in order to influence their networks into group buying and sharing for discounts. Its market has been projected to be worth roughly $150 billion by 2020, meaning that it will possess a noticeable part of the overall e-commerce environment. China appears to care deeply about social shopping, so luxury brands who hope to continue capitalizing on the 33 percent of the revenue that Chinese consumers contribute to the $1.2 trillion trade in luxury products simply must pay attention.", "One of the appeals of social shopping is that it offers the safety and mutual reinforcement of a communal experience. Users can create networks and then share and promote Pinduoduo-listed products through WeChat, resulting in group discounts, competitions, and other incentivized purchases. This disruptive \u201cteam purchasing\u201d idea has resonated particularly well in a culture where online commerce had previously been centralized by the Alibaba/JD duopoly. Shaun Rein, the author of \u201cThe War for China\u2019s Wallet: Profiting from the New World Order,\u201d states, \u201cThe potential of social commerce is huge because people like to buy what their friends recommend. Increasingly, in China\u2019s e-commerce landscape, people don\u2019t know what sales channel to trust, but if they see their friends purchasing things on social commerce sites, they are more likely to buy.\u201d For cautious Chinese consumers approaching expensive branded purchases for the first time, this kind of peer endorsement is vital. Therefore, the social commerce model seems like a natural fit with luxury goods \u2014 but also a possible future home for fake listings.", "The days of trading down may be limited", "Pinduoduo is acknowledged as a place for lower-income shoppers to buy everyday goods rather than high-end brands, but that doesn\u2019t mean the market might not have the capacity to support luxury items. Although many social commerce shoppers currently have the desire to purchase luxury goods, their limited financial circumstances mean that cheap \u201cshanzhai\u201d mass copies are more common purchases.", "However, younger and wealthier Chinese shoppers in the current climate expect unique luxury items and are increasingly willing to pay for them. As these Millennial and Gen-Z consumers represent an influential segment on social media, the energy that they devote to promoting themselves and their purchases will likely drive purchase mimicry throughout the country. With continued economic growth and increased purchasing power \u2014 even in the provincial cities \u2014 the desire for genuine luxury products will become more prevalent, but so too will the appearance of counterfeits that are closer to the real thing; so-called \u201csuper fakes.\u201d", "As brands become more common and less exclusive in rural locations, the drive for more expensive products and higher-end brands may also increase. This process already started in August 2018 when Pinduoduo committed to an escalation of branded goods through a \u201cPavilion\u201d that would push global brands out to the provinces (a big part of the platform\u2019s buyer base). And further subsidies for farmers, poverty alleviation initiatives, and e-commerce training sessions suggest that the social commerce market will likely reach new heights in the future.", "The West has been here before", "When the first wave of e-commerce appeared in the \u201890s, it was a revolutionary new way for all brands to bring goods directly to customers. This was particularly important for the luxury sector because sales could suddenly be increased in untapped Asian markets. Distance and cost had made establishing brick-and-mortar retail units prohibitively expensive, but e-commerce presented a real solution. Many marketplaces were initially unregulated, though, and this led to waves of listings for counterfeit products, which destabilized profits. When brand protection initiatives like eBay\u2019s VeRO program began later in the decade, it set in motion the marketplace-centric brand protection strategies that still exist to this day.", "But if anything serves as a template for how social media will pose a future threat to brands in China, it\u2019s what\u2019s currently happening across the U.S. and Europe. Sellers of luxury brands such as Michael Kors, Rolex, and Gucci have migrated in droves to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, leading to record seizures and regular headlines. Sellers establish interpersonal relationships within private groups and then communicate via encrypted Whatsapp messages with buyers. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s also found its feet with Chinese counterfeiters who use channels like WeChat, Instagram, YuPoo and TikTok as additional arms to reach both Chinese and international customers.", "Managing disruption", "Pinduoduo and other social commerce disruptors have shown that the conventional marketplace model of buying and selling counterfeit goods is changing. For luxury brands who want to capitalize on the Chinese appetite for expensive products while limiting the number of fake products sold online, developing social shopping awareness is crucial.

Declines in weaker luxury brands will be balanced by gains for stronger brands.", "One reason strong brands resist shocks like tariff-increases is that they\u2019ve created significant value for consumers. Real luxury is nothing other than extreme value creation.

Many Pininfarina-designed cars wore the company\u2019s name proudly on the side. However, after decades of designing cars for others, Pininfarina has launched its own car this week, at the Geneva Motor Show, and is now sporting its iconic name on the front and back instead. The car itself is a remarkable feat of design, styling, and engineering, redefining what luxury means for automobiles.", "And this is important, as we are in an era of disruption. Luxury consumers all over the world are getting younger, more sophisticated, and hungry for authentic experiences. With many of them living in highly urbanized environments like Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, or Los Angeles, they experience a world in which pollution is becoming an increasing problem. It\u2019s not surprising that more than 80 percent of all-electric vehicles in the world are bought by Chinese consumers, and that in cities like Shanghai, electric scooters have practically replaced gasoline-powered motorcycles that were ubiquitous until seven or eight years ago.", "Times are changing. In a few years, many of today\u2019s megacities will no longer allow cars that aren\u2019t zero-emission. In my point of view, many of the traditional premium and luxury carmakers are moving far too slowly in that direction, and consequently, risk that newcomers will leapfrog and win this new game. It\u2019s not surprising that Tesla already dominates the U.S. luxury segment with its Model S and X, and its Model 3 just became the bestselling electric car, even before becoming available in large numbers in Europe and China. While in China, hundreds \u2014 yes, hundreds \u2014 of electric car manufacturers have already launched vehicles or are ready to go, which is a fact that many people in Europe or the U.S. don\u2019t realize.

One of the reasons is that to be perceived as a luxury, at least one performance criteria needs to be extreme. There are few successful examples, with prominent failures like the BMW i8, which in my view is too much of a compromise between the old gasoline world and the electric future. A car journalist described the i8 to me as a \u201cfaster Prius\u201d \u2014 certainly not a compliment, and certainly not enough to be convincing as a powerful luxury sports car.

Difficult for Marketers to Use", "Although a brand\u2019s audience may be using Douyin, so far, the platform hasn\u2019t made it easy for brands and marketers to target specific users.", "Currently, the main options for marketers are to a) run an official campaign which will be featured prominently on the platform and hopefully be seen by your target audience or b) work with KOLs (key opinion leaders \u2013 China\u2019s internet influencers) whose audience matches yours.

Now, one video from a top tier Douyin influencer (with an average of one million views)\u00a0commands 120,000 RMB ($1,876). For context, a post from a top tier Weibo influencer (China\u2019s answer to Twitter) is around 30,000 RMB ($4689.75) per one million impressions and a top-tier WeChat influencer 75,000 RMB for 75,000 impressions.", "Influencers aside, according to many luxury brands, Douyin has also hiked up its prices for official campaigns. While the cost is higher, there is more competition than before. Last year, Audi and Michael Kors were some of the first luxury brands to run campaigns on the app. Now there are many more on the platform, including Xiaomi, Airbnb, Adidas, Pizza Hut, and Haidilao.", "On the flip side", "When it comes to demographics, Bern pointed out that brands need to think long term, using the app now to cultivate relationships with young consumers that will have spending power in the future, \u201cChinese cities are growing, and what may be be a third-tier city may be a second or even first tier city in a couple of years.\u201d", "And it is likely that these young consumers will eventually have higher disposable incomes.

A couple of differences include Snow\u2019s ability to let the user create a GIF to send in a message, share a video, and photo filters, which are a particularly coveted feature for Chinese users. Snapchat, like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, is blocked in China, so it\u2019s not really uncommon to find copycats (China\u2019s Weibo has been compared to Twitter, while social network Renren has\u00a0similarities to Facebook).", "Possibly to take extra precaution against also getting blocked in China, Snow recently released an app specifically for the China market without its \u201cstory\u201d function, or the in-app messaging capabilities that, like Snapchat, are only visible for 24 hours after posting. China\u2019s version of Snow instead lets users connect the app with their WeChat accounts, meaning they can only send photos, GIFs and video created on Snow through WeChat.

We like to think of ourselves as an agency that evolves with the changing times.", "Give us a sense of the advertising and marketing landscape in China. Why are social media and digital marketing so important?", "The advertising and marketing landscape in China is, like everywhere else, going through a massive transformation, but the change here is slightly different. With tight regulations on television content, Chinese have flooded to video websites for their entertainment. They engage far more on social media than their Western counterparts. And they trust recommendations from other netizens as much as their own friends and colleagues. E-commerce is not just a convenient thing as it is in the West; it\u2019s an evolved retail channel allowing brands a connection to millions of consumers that no one ever imagined.", "Digital and social play an important role in both awareness and consideration phases, particularly in luxury goods where consumers are eager to show off their new luxury purchase or discover some new limited edition find. In a place where everyone is in fear of getting ripped off, social media allows consumers an open access to product owners to gauge opinions and recommendations.", "In terms of social media and digital marketing, what approaches work best in the Chinese market? How is China different from other countries in this regard?", "The China digital/social media landscape is highly fragmented and there\u2019s no single Facebook/Twitter channel, but in fact several different versions targeting different groups. There\u2019s no single place where everyone goes, and to be successful in China, you have to be everywhere, which poses an enormous challenge. We recommend to our clients to take a micro-strategy approach, lead with campaigns that excite and entertain consumers, while giving them opportunities to learn more about your brand, and yes, you can lead them to a purchase opportunity while you\u2019re at it. Our most successful campaigns have been those that have taken a single idea and expanded it through a myriad of different executions. Ultimately you need to get people involved, and if you compare Chinese social media content to what is seen in the West, you will see stuff that\u2019s really amped up and engaging. In that way, social media here is way ahead of the West.", "What are some of the common mistakes brands make when marketing to upscale Chinese consumers?", "Upscale brands often fail to take into account that their target audience in China is way younger to the group they normally target in Europe. Of course there\u2019s a certain image that luxury brands need to project but it\u2019s done much more conservatively than it needs to be, and the engagement strategy has to be more engaging than print ads at the airport or some VIP event. It\u2019s therefore not a coincidence to see marketers from the fast-moving consumer goods business moving into the luxury gigs where they can value from their channel marketing expertise.", "There are still many, many brands that the Chinese don\u2019t know about but would love to learn about. Those brands that connect with Chinese consumers are those willing to invest in China for the long term. There are no short-term winners here.", "What advice about social media and digital marketing would you give a company trying to break into the China luxury market?", "China\u2019s most famous blogger, Han Han, once said that brands forget that Chinese computer consists of both a screen but also a keyboard. His point here is that China social media is much more two-way, involved and engaging than what you might see on Facebook. Your task as a brand, therefore, is to create campaigns that get Chinese netizens to participate, not just to watch. To make matters more challenging, the average Chinese follows only eight companies on their Weibo, compared to 15 companies for the average American. Your social media campaigns, therefore, need to be \u201cdialed up,\u201d providing content that followers can\u2019t wait to forward to their friends. If you\u2019re simply posting product pictures you will lose. You need to give your local teams in China a lot more leverage to do what they want. Luxury is no different from any other category.", "Tell us about one or two of your recent social media and digital marketing campaigns that were especially successful.", "In the luxury category, Wunderman\u2019s \u201cEvoque My Style\u201d campaign for Land Rover stands out to me as both an engaging and highly effective use of social media. The campaign ran for almost six months through various integrated phases that included a series of opportunities for netizens to contribute content, participate in activities, and interact with a virtual Range Rover Evoque online.

Audi, BMW, Land Rover, and MINI all lead the field because they have such reach and integration amongst all the different platforms. Est\u00e9e Lauder is also a major standout. Like Burberry, they are willing to go beyond simple product postings and create content the leads to consumer involvement.", "How would you describe your dream client?", "I\u2019m very lucky that I have many dream clients.\u00a0They are especially open-minded and above all, willing to try new ideas, but most importantly they are willing to take chances and are not necessarily worried about failure. They demand their agencies to be proactive and involved in their business. They share feedback on a quarterly basis and work with us to improve our mutual performance.", "Anything else you\u2019d like to add?", "China\u2019s social media space offers an enormous opportunity for luxury brands to connect with Chinese consumers who are eager to learn more about new brands. But this engagement is not simply about posting Facebook-like content onto Weibo, but providing originally created integrated programs that extend across different channels. It requires money: you have to invest in Baidu search to get noticed because the platform is largely \u201cpay to play\u201d so organic search is relatively ineffective as it might be in other markets.

What would you say has been the most challenging for Bundshop?", "Bundshop (B): We came up with the idea in January to build a B2B platform in China, but weren\u2019t really sure what that platform would look like. We saw that there weren\u2019t Chinese designers in the international market, then the question became, why is that? Before building something entirely isolated from the reality of what Chinese designers needed, we basically threw ourselves into the design community in Shanghai and did many interviews back-to-back.\u00a0", "The question we constantly asked was why is it that you have this amazing content, these beautiful designs, and your stories aren\u2019t reaching international markets? And the answers we got back were, right now if we want to sell abroad, we really can\u2019t. It\u2019s very difficult for us to get into B2B channels and control the quality of our brands and the projection of our story. If we\u2019re online, we have a couple of challenges. First the platform that we can use, like Ebay, Etsy, and Amazon, with each of these platforms, our brand is diluted. It\u2019s the same effect on Taobao. The other option is for a designer to have his or her own website, at which point they\u2019re on their own with copyrighting, translating, marketing, distribution and logistics, and when you have to handle all of that as a small brand or designer, there\u2019s pretty much no way to design anymore. ", "So, listening to that, clearly, there\u2019s a couple things going on. First, we need to create a platform, that is brand-consistent. We have to create something that is aesthetically as beautiful as what our designers are creating, so it has to be really, really comprehensive. Second, it has to be way more than just selling products, it has to be telling stories. We\u2019re not just crossing geographical boundaries, it\u2019s also very much cultural boundaries and facing pre-judgments of Western consumers about Made in China and the concept of manufactured in China, which means you really have to communicate on an emotional level.", "Glazedrop Tea Set by Yasi", "JD: Having recently launched, how\u2019s the reception to Bundshop been so far?", "B: It\u2019s been quite good, actually. We always knew that there was going be a lot of interest in the concept of Chinese design. What it comes down to now is market research and analysis into which products sell well, which designer\u2019s story. It\u2019s always going to be an optimization game at this point. It\u2019s going to take time to optimize our platform and the way we present our designers and the products we select. In terms of sales, they\u2019re trickling in. We\u2019re just starting out, so it\u2019s definitely going, but the challenges of building in that referral system and incentive to actually drive sales is something that we are concerned about.

They\u2019re in the low hundreds of dollars, not very expensive, great and easy to ship. At the same time, our Sozen vases have been doing very well too \u2014 the bamboo and ceramic vases. NonoMuaks has also done very well.\u00a0Compared to our other designers, they\u2019re a bit more of a refined brand, very street style, very bold. Their price points are a bit lower than the rest of our brands. ", "Those are the three brands that are doing the best right now. In terms of early adopters and who is buying, we actually have more orders from Shanghai than we had expected. The expat community in Shanghai has taken to this very well. Some of our goods make really good presents back home, you know it\u2019s the holiday rush. In Shanghai, you can go to one of the street markets and buy something and you\u2019re not guaranteed of the quality of that product. With us, of course we guarantee the quality of our products, so customers tend to feel a lot more secure buying with us. Also, we ship to the US, which makes it so much easier.

Another demographic that we see emerging is middle-aged housewives \u2014 it\u2019s that Pinterest crowd. We are actually very active on Pinterest.

At the end of the day, we\u2019re an e-commerce website because we have to be. On one side, we have to make a living. This is a business. But on the other side, what we care more about than anything in the world is helping rebrand China from \u201cMade in China\u201d to \u201cDesigned in China.\u201d If we could, we would just give away all of our products to show everyone how amazing Designed in China is and the quality of our goods.

", "As David Jia explained it, \u201cTo me, the identity of Chinese Design is warmth and all-encompassing.\u201d In terms of our designers, most are in their thirties and have a very specific Chinese heritage that is deeply embedded in their work. What they make has a very Chinese taste to it, but this new generation of designers coming up right now that is being trained in design and art schools with a more Western eye for design. The window of designers, now mature designers, offers the world a glimpse at the first designs born from China\u2019s opening to the international world. It will likely be decades before this style happens again, when the current class of industrial design students is ready to turn inwards to their roots, rather than outwards to western academic education, for inspiration.It is this cycle in which art kind of turns in on itself, this general ebb and flow.", "Right now, the designers are so introspective in terms of their own heritage, so right now what they design is very China related. But maybe in the next ten years, it\u2019ll be a more of a Western imitation, and it\u2019ll come back as a backlash and lead to a revival of more ancient Chinese art forms.", "JD: So, you\u2019re definitely seeing an internal shift in Chinese design culture? As much as you\u2019re trying to change the Western perspective of Chinese design, Chinese design is changing itself.", "Lab Lamp by John Meng", "B: Right. When you look at our designers who are in their thirties, none of them have a formal design background. A lot of them come from calligraphy, or a lot of them have parents who are classically trained artists, which is why Chinese heritage is so deeply embedded in their design identity. But, now that there are so many design schools that do teach very Western styles, churning out the next generation of designers who are just graduating now. They have less of a connection and they\u2019re just more of a rebellious class. Most likely, their parents wanted them to go into engineering, something more conventional. They said no, I want to go into design. ", "We\u2019ll see, but perhaps it\u2019ll be a complete backlash to this previous generation in design where China is very visible in their design. But, of course, when you\u2019re rebelling against something, that something is very intrinsically inside what you create. So, perhaps we\u2019ll see China emerging in very unexpected places in the future.", "JD: Do you plan to remain an e-commerce website? What can we expect from Bundshop next?", "B: We started out wanting to be a kick-starter for design in China. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll go back once we have a consumer base that trusts us to being a crowd-funding platform for Chinese design. Each one of these designers is a case study for us to see what kind of branding works and doesn\u2019t work in places like the US.

Yesterday, along with an interview of the social media and e-commerce manager at the Mandarin Oriental (forthcoming on Jing Daily), one of the more interesting events was a panel led by Jennifer Cheng of Fireworks Internet, discussing two new startups in Hong Kong that cater towards high-end demographics via tailor-made membership services: Glamabox (cosmetics) and the soon-to-launch Gourmei (fine dining).", "Co-founded by local celebrity Lisa S, Glamabox \u2014 which custom-develops monthly boxes of cosmetic samples for members, shipped directly from brands to end-users \u2014 currently has around 10,000 members in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, and offers users additional services through the member community, including\u00a0video blogs and celebrity advice. Deep integration with social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Weibo and the Blogger network make all content highly shareable across all platforms, a feature that panel members agreed was key to success. Costing around HK$100 per month, and available on month-to-month, six month, or one year subscription plans, Glamabox skews to a younger demographic, though Cheng noted that middle-aged members are increasing rapidly, and surveys in the cosmetic industry are always to be taken with a grain of salt, because people tend to\u00a0\u201clie about their age.\u201d", "Launching within the next month, the second company discussed at the panel was Gourmei, a membership community \u201cfor restaurants and foodies\u201d in Hong Kong. Gourmei will offer a range of perks for users, including restaurant news and recommendations, last-minute reservations and a mobile app. As with Glamabox, panel members noted that the membership model is important in premium industries, as it helps develop filters to reach the right consumers: demographics (right age groups, user bases), purchasing power (via paid subscriptions) and tailoring (to ensure users don\u2019t receive unwanted items). All attendees agreed that customization and strong social media integration are crucial for key demographics, as social media is \u201ceffective, fast and instant\u201d and \u2014 for restaurants in particular \u2014 traditional media channels are no longer offering the same return on investment that they once did.", "Though making up only two segments of the luxury industry, the emergence of service-based companies like Glamabox and Gourmei in Hong Kong \u2014 and their popularity in the Greater China region \u2014 indicates we may see the same developing clout in mainland China\u2019s luxury industry; Not simply in cosmetics or cuisine, but fashion, wine and jewelry as well. With the country\u2019s e-commerce market booming, along with luxury demand among an emerging and tech-savvy second- and third-tier consumer, it\u2019s only a matter of time before luxury brands see value in tailor-making packages for membership club members of a certain level of purchasing power in China. For its part, Glamabox plans to enter the mainland China market this month, offering users payment options through Alipay.", "Already, we\u2019re seeing this happen with the growing number of wine subscription services popping up in the mainland China market, but other areas are ripe for experimentation.", "Social Media Week Hong Kong runs through February 17.

Though the sale was 95 percent sold by lot, with Sotheby\u2019s holding that the auction \u201cbreathes fire into the wine market\u201d during the first week of the Chinese Year of the Dragon, Bloomberg writes today that dealers say the total was close to auction forecasts, with the selling rate benefiting from lower pre-sale estimates. Less enthusiastic bidding from Asian collectors indicates that this increasingly important buyer class is taking a breather \u2014 at least at far-flung auctions heavy on Bordeaux. This is having knock-down effects on prices for prestige bottles, with prices dropping 20 percent from the market highs achieved in the middle of last year. However, according to Miles Davis, partner at Wine Asset Managers LLP, this is to be expected.

The most expensive was a 12-bottle case of Chateau Petrus from the highly rated 1982 vintage. This sold for US$61,493 with fees, over a high estimate of $56,617, around 35 percent less than the $94,047 spent by an Asian buyer for the same wine in London last summer.", "Despite less of a presence among often free-spending Asian buyers, auction houses insist they\u2019re not going anywhere, and will come back strong in a more diverse range of wine segments.

In 2011, two-thirds of all the lots valued at more than 10,000 pounds at Christie\u2019s auctions in the U.S., Europe and Hong Kong fell to Asian bidders, according to David Elswood, the company\u2019s London-based head of wine.", "\u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of demand in Asia,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back.\u201d", "The Sotheby\u2019s sale provided further evidence of demand for Bordeaux second-growth wines, which have attracted interest from Asian buyers as prices of the more expensive first-growths have become more volatile in recent months.", "One such second growth is Leoville Las Cases, a Saint- Julien estate in the Medoc just to the south of Chateau Latour which has been a top wine producer of the region for more than 250 years. Three cases of Leoville Las Cases 1982 sold for 3,680 pounds each, above their upper estimate and close to the $6,100 achieved at an Acker auction in Hong Kong in November, while others in the sale achieved their estimated range.", "As Jing Daily noted earlier this month, look for Asian buyers \u2014 particularly those from the Greater China region \u2014 to focus their efforts on top Burgundy while expanding their horizons somewhat this year, gradually diversifying away from \u201cbig label\u201d Bordeaux.

Shoppers in top-tier cities are more discriminating; the best real estate is now hard to come by and increasingly expensive; some consumers will cut back if a wider perception of an economic slowdown occurs; and brands that depend too much on mainland Chinese tourists to spend in Hong Kong or Macau stand to lose if China\u2019s much-maligned luxury taxes are reduced.", "Tory Burch\u2019s first mainland China location in Beijing", "Mashable looks this week at the role that digital marketing has played in building the American fashion brand Tory Burch.

Buoyed by mainland China\u2019s new collectors, who have emerged as some of the world\u2019s most voracious buyers of art, gold and jewelry, and fine wine since 2008, ArtTactic\u2019s confidence indicator \u201cremains strongly positive,\u201d though the differences between domestic Chinese and international auction houses are becoming increasingly stark. While the sustainability of the current growth rates remains suspect, a majority of respondents continue to believe the Chinese contemporary art market will grow in the next six months. What all this boils down to is the same thing Jing Daily and other market observers have said over the past two years: the Chinese contemporary art market is inevitably moving towards quality. This, perhaps more than anything, is why ArtTactic points out in this study that a gap in risk perception remains between the Hong Kong and mainland China contemporary auction markets, with the Risk Barometer for the mainland auction market coming in 49 percent higher than the international Hong Kong market. Some of the highlights of the new survey: \u2013 Confidence in the Chinese contemporary art market remains high despite art market confidence dropping sharply in the US & European contemporary market in October 2011. \u2013 The recent financial turmoil in Europe and US does not seem to have filtered down to the Chinese art market yet. The overall ArtTactic Chinese Art Market Confidence Indicator for November 2011 came in at 80, only 2 percent below the record reading in April 2011. \u2013 The Chinese contemporary art market has been on a \u201crapid path of recovery\u201d since February 2009, and the latest reading in November 2011 indicates that a majority of experts surveyed remain positive about the Chinese contemporary art market in the next six months. \u2013 51 percent of the experts still believe the market will go up in the coming six months (down from 76 percent in April 2011).", "While confidence is being tested by economic issues in the US & Europe, it remains far higher than two years ago", "In terms of the risk projection, Hong Kong\u2019s far more internationalized auction market \u2014 in which major auction houses like Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s can operate \u2014 continues to garner more confidence from collectors than mainland Chinese houses like China Guardian or Poly. As Jing Daily has noted before, mainland Chinese houses promote a certain set of contemporary artists and Hong Kong\u00a0promotes\u00a0another, and although there are signs of overlap between the two (with certain artists, such as Zeng Fanzhi and Liu Ye proving popular in both mainland China and Hong Kong), ArtTactic notes that the Chinese contemporary art market may largely remain on a \u201ctwo-track journey.\u201d In the new survey, ArtTactic\u2019s Risk Barometer for the International Chinese Contemporary Art market came in at 4.4. While this is an increase of 10 percent since April 2011, this remains below the \u201cmedium\u201d risk level, suggesting that the current recovery is \u201cgrowing at a healthy speed without strong elements of speculation.\u201d The Speculation Barometer sits at 6.4 at the upper \u201cmedium\u201d level, but has only risen two percent since the last study this spring. For the mainland China market, naturally the proliferation of upstart, unproven auction houses has had a negative effect on ArtTactic\u2019s Risk Barometer, which currently comes in\u00a0at 6.7, 49 percent higher than the International Chinese market. Still, this remains within the \u201cupper medium\u201d risk level. Speculation in the mainland China auction market remains a distinct concern, however, with inflows of\u00a0new speculative and short-term investment capital from private, as well as institutional (art funds and investment trusts) raise concerns about the sustainability of the rapid growth of the mainland Chinese art market. What all this boils down to is that the Chinese art market recovery has attracted a great deal of \u201chot money,\u201d while Hong Kong is better positioned for more sustainable growth. Not a surprise, but an\u00a0important\u00a0trend to keep in mind. In terms of valuations, the US$50,000-100,000 price segment has seen the strongest increase in confidence over the past six months, driven mostly by the recent auction results at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong. This price segment, which accounted for only one percent of the total at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong in spring 2010, rose to seven percent of the total this autumn. While a majority of experts surveyed remain positive about the top price segment (over US$1 million), confidence has weakened in the $500,000-1 million segment.", "Confidence in Zhang Xiaogang continues to rise, with the artist breaking the US$10 million mark last spring", "Artist confidence remains high at the top-tier, with 67 percent of artists now having a reading above 50, indicating there is more positive than negative sentiment towards the artist\u2019s market. In the Top 10 Short-Term Confidence Ranking, Zeng Fanzhi has moved from fourth place to first, and four new entries have taken their places in the top ten: Song Dong (now second place, up from 12th), Zhang Xiaogang (fourth, up from 11th), Li Songsong (sixth, up from 15th), and Gu Wenda (eighth, up from 19th). In terms of long-term confidence,\u00a035 percent of artists (18 out of 52) have seen a positive increase over the past six months. Among the top 10 artists that the experts believe will stand\u00a0the test of time are Ai Weiwei, Cai Guoqiang, Zeng Fanzhi, Yang Fudong, Zhan Wang and Xu Zhen. ArtTactic does note that there have been some changes to the top 10 since April 2011, however, with Zhang Peili, Song Dong, Xu Bing and Zhang Xiaogang entering the list. Though several artists in these lists have seen a drop in their confidence levels since April, ArtTactic echoes what Jing Daily has said before: that a select group of blue-chip Chinese contemporary artists have firmly established themselves, and will in all likelihood remain, in the long-term performers category \u2014 including Ai Weiwei, Cai Guoqiang, Zhang Peili, Zeng Fanzhi, Xu Bing, Song Dong , Zhang Xiaogang, and Yang Fudong. As for the collector base of Chinese contemporary art, Asian collectors continue to dominate as they have since 2008, when Western collectors cut back in the wake of the global financial crisis. Though Taiwanese collectors remain the most powerful force in the Chinese contemporary art market, one important finding in ArtTactic\u2019s new survey is that mainland Chinese \u201cnew collectors\u201d have risen into the top five collector segments,\u00a0ahead of American collectors and Indonesian collectors. Perceptions among respondents towards mainland Chinese collectors are now shifting, with ArtTactic noting that observers have largely validated the \u201cnew trend of growing interest in contemporary art from mainland China.\u201d Look for this to continue as more new collectors enter the market. As Shanghai-based \u201csuper-collector\u201d Liu Yiqian observed this past August, \u201cOver the past five years, there were only a few collectors involved with this market, and [I was] therefore quite familiar with buyers as well as sellers. But this situation has changed [in 2011], as half of the buyers are even new to me.\u201d", "Overall, the latest ArtTactic survey indicates that the Chinese contemporary art market (at the upper-middle to top-tier) is moving towards more sustainable growth and quality. This is very much a positive trend, and one that\u2019s absolutely necessary. As Chinese collectors continue to become more discriminating \u2014 with many passing up lower-quality works by blue-chip artists at the recent Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong autumn auctions \u2014 we should see prices for many artists stabilize or trend towards slower growth. If these artists can remain insulated from the \u201chot money\u201d inflows that are contributing to the myriad problems facing upstart domestic Chinese auction houses (unsustainable growth rates, issues with collecting payment, counterfeiting controversies), they will likely see their long-term confidence rankings and auction sales prices remain among the highest in the global\u00a0contemporary\u00a0art world. Luckily, top-tier artists like Zeng Fanzhi, Zhang Xiaogang, Fang Lijun and Yue Minjun \u2014 who are widely sold on the internationalized Hong Kong auction market \u2014 should see little to no ill effect from issues in the mainland China auction market.", "The international and mainland China art markets are very different, but have significant crossover", "// \n(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" mce_src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&amp;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()\n// ]]&gt;"]}, {"title": "Mercedes-Benz China Fashion Week Kicks Off In Beijing (Photos)", "meta": "October 25, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Schumacher\u2019s S/S 2012 collection at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Night Out", "Running from October 24 to November 2, Mercedes-Benz China Fashion Week S/S 2012 launched this week at 751 D-Park in Beijing\u2019s 798 Art Zone.

Last year, Louis Vuitton registered record sales of $138 million in the city, while Cartier generated more revenue in Chengdu than in any other city in China.\u00a0This August, at\u00a0a fashion event in Chengdu, Liu Ruiming,\u00a0editor-in-chief of Forbes China, projected that luxury sales in Chengdu will soon reach 10 billion yuan (US$1.57 billion), making it one of China\u2019s largest single high-end markets. But, sales figures and (at times breathless) media coverage aside, what\u2019s actually happening on the ground in Chengdu?", "To get a better sense of the trends currently shaping this vast metropolitan area, home to over 14 million people, Jing Daily analyst Betty Chen recently spoke to an operations manager of a major global luxury brand \u2014 who, due to company policy, spoke on the condition of anonymity \u2014 about the current state of the Chengdu luxury market, the buying behavior of locals, the service level of luxury professionals, and more. Interview translated from the original Mandarin Chinese.", "Jing Daily (JD): What would you say is the current state of the Chengdu luxury market?", "Operations Manager (OM): The urban culture of Chengdu is more open, which originally attracted several foreign high-end malls, such as Pacific Department Store. Compared to my previous working experience in other cities, I\u2019d say Chengdu is way more open, so many\u00a0top-tier brands have chosen to enter the city, especially early on when they consider expanding into second-tier markets. ", "Chengdu\u2019s Maison Mode can be considered the city\u2019s first luxury department store, since it introduced lots of world-class brands to the city. Right now, Hong Kong\u2019s Wharf Holdings is building the International Financial Center (IFC) here, and I believe IFC Chengdu will attract even more top-tier brands. But there are other examples of the city\u2019s importance to luxury brands. Herm\u00e8s\u00a0chose Chengdu to open its first boutique in western China, and Chanel chose Far Eastern Pacific Department Store for its first store in Chengdu. ", "As I said, the luxury market is growing very quickly here, due to the open culture of the city. As far as I know, many high-end brands have done very well in Chengdu, and a few of them are already planning to open a second store here.

Foreign luxury shopping malls will also bring more premium brands to the city. The pressure on local shopping malls will be relatively high, so they\u2019ll have to constantly adjust their brand portfolios. Although competition is becoming increasingly fierce, the luxury market in Chengdu should be getting better and better. The more stores open, the bigger the market will be.", "JD: In general, how do you perceive attitudes towards luxury among\u00a0Chinese consumers?", "OM: Generally speaking, I think their attitude towards shopping is relatively impulsive. It will take some time to enhance their brand awareness. Although some top brands sell well, they don\u2019t adequately educate their customers and enhance brand understanding. This is especially true for brand agents \u2014 when they start to sell luxury brands, they totally disregard the concept of brand education, so many customers have no sense of the deeper concepts or pedigrees conveyed by the brands.", "JD: Who would you say are the main luxury consumers in Chengdu?", "OM: The luxury consumer base in Chengdu can range from members of the \u201cpost-9os generation\u201d to people over the age of 50. Some young consumers shop with their parents, and others come with their friends. Now, some top-tier brands are very\u00a0diverse\u00a0in terms of product lines and styles, and they try to attract customers of all ages. For example, some brands want to appeal to parents as well as their children.", "JD: Can you say a little bit about the shopping behavior of Chengdu consumers?", "OM: Currently, most new customers still prefer to buy products they\u2019re familiar with. For example, some classic styles sell very well. But I think the \u201cpost-80s/90s\u201d shoppers may accept new things much easier than their older\u00a0counterparts, although the latter group accounts for a larger\u00a0proportion\u00a0of luxury consumption.

Although these domestic high-end brands sometimes sell well, they\u2019re still inferior to their foreign counterparts in terms of operations, CRM, etc.", "\u00a0", "JD: While living standards in Chengdu have gradually increased, there\u2019s still a gap here relative to top-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Do you think luxury consumers in Chengdu are more price-sensitive?", "OM: In my opinion, consumers who are able to afford luxury seldom complain about prices. They should have prepared themselves psychologically before hitting the mall, and have a rough sense of what they expect to spend. Moreover, the products they like to buy should be familiar to their friends and family. However, some customers have been known to complain about prices in Chengdu after buying similar items at a lower price in Hong Kong or overseas. ", "Now, Sanya in Hainan has launched a duty-free luxury shopping program, which gives consumers a benchmark from which they can compare prices domestically. Also, some customers come to stores here to compare styles and sizes locally before shopping abroad. ", "JD: How do you feel about consumers here? What pushes someone to shop locally?", "OM: In Chengdu, many luxury brands put a lot of effort into retaining customers. Lots of brands have regular consumers who often spend a certain amount of money on particular products. In terms of what pushes them to buy locally, some buy for\u00a0themselves, and others buy as gifts. The proportion of luxury items bought as gifts has increased in recent years.", "\u00a0", "High-end brands are flocking to Chengdu luxury malls", "JD: What are some of the major challenges you see in the Chengdu luxury market?", "OM: Aside from fierce competition, I think most top-tier brands do pretty well in Chengdu.

China\u2019s luxury market is growing rapidly, and sometimes the training process seems a little flimsy. Many brands want to hire people who can immediately handle the work.

For instance, Art HK (as of May now 60 percent owned by Art Basel) has, in recent years, been recognized as a leading art fair not only in Asia but globally as well.

The reasons go beyond \u201cvanity\u201d or \u201cblindness,\u201d because no one wants to hear that kind of judgment.

This isn\u2019t exclusive to luxury consumption but you can see it in all kinds of consumption. It all goes from fanatical to rational. Look at the house-buying fever in China right now.

We can\u2019t just look at the speed at which China\u2019s luxury market has grown and make a snap conclusion based on that.", "Ifeng: Do you think Chinese consumers need guidance on their values concerning luxury consumption? If so, how should they be guided?", "HZ: Not just their values about luxury consumption, but their values as a whole need guidance. The fever for luxury goods will cool down when everyone can afford luxury goods. The current twisted consumption stems from a lack of faith, compassion and empathy.

Meanwhile, a chorus of media commentators have argued for and against the tax cuts, with some advocating higher luxury taxes and others saying they should be abolished completely.", "As the debate goes on, luxury brands appear to have taken steps to combat tax cuts before they\u2019ve even materialized. As an survey by the newspaper Beijing Business Today found this week, major brands have increased prices at Beijing malls, in some cases dramatically, over the past few months. According to the survey, since July 1, Rolex increased prices in mainland China by five percent, Chanel by 20 percent, Celine by anywhere from 200-1,000 yuan, and Lady Dior by upwards of 4,000 yuan.

This March, Louis Vuitton increased prices in overseas markets an average of five percent. As a staff member at Cartier confirmed, Cartier completed a price adjustment on July 1 of between 8-20 percent. But as early as March 17, Cartier already raised prices 5-10 percent. According to reports, luxury brands increase retail prices once or twice every year, on average five percent each time. However, the interval between recent price increases [in China] is considered\u00a0unusually\u00a0short.", "Still, reporters found that the price increases did little to dissuade Chinese consumers from shopping.

Many shoppers come in here looking to buy a particular item, and don\u2019t even ask about the price\u201d.", "Cutting one tax among many might not be enough to dissuade Hong Kong-bound tourist-shoppers", "Although a spokesperson for Chanel said the price increases were mainly due to a spike in the price of raw materials like leather, and industry insiders have also pointed at the depreciation of the euro, Beijing Business Today is firmly convinced that the relative strengthening of the Chinese yuan, as well as the possible luxury tax reduction, are mostly to blame, writing:", "Industry insiders believe that after China\u2019s [rumored] import tax reductions, the retail price gap between major international luxury brands and domestic Chinese luxury brands will be lessened, and since these global brands worry that this would damage their high-end image, they want to increase prices pre-emptively. ", "As always, it pays to take this survey with something of a grain of salt, since it only focuses on Beijing, but if prices for luxury goods truly are rising faster in mainland China than elsewhere, it could give ammunition to those who argue that the possible luxury tax cuts would have little effect on Hong Kong\u2019s luxury market.

In late 2007, Wang created her own label, Fei Wang Sunglasses, and has since sold her hand-made, European-manufactured sunglasses online and in boutiques in London and Japan. This week, Jing Daily spoke to Wang about her upcoming expansion plans and the developing potential she sees among Chinese consumers.", "Jing Daily (JD): First, can you tell us a little about yourself and your business, in terms of how you first became interested in eyewear design and sunglasses?", " Fei Wang (FW): I\u2019ve been interested in eyewear since I was little. I was always wearing glasses, since I was short-sighted. My dad wears glasses, all of my family are four-eyes\u2026so I\u2019ve always been interested in eyewear. What made me start doing what I do is because being [Asian], I can\u2019t find glasses, especially good-styled glasses that actually fit our facial features. We normally have high cheekbones and low nose-bridges and the distance between the temple is slightly different than Caucasians. So it\u2019s been my own frustration of not being able to find anything that fits me and also, design-wise, never being able to find anything I really like.", "I used to complain to people, why can\u2019t I find things, then I thought I\u2019d do it myself. So when it started, I actually looked for somebody who could make me bespoke glasses, and it took me a little while to find a manufacturer and do the design. It came out really well so I thought, \u201cI can share this with other people.\u201d That\u2019s how the business came about, really.", "JD: What year was that, that you really started [Fei Wang]?", "FW: The business started around 2007. It took me around a year to find the right manufacturer and get the design done, so the business actually started late 2007.", "JD:\u00a0So you first started thinking about making the Asian-focused eyewear pretty early on then?", "FW: Yes, I had thought about it for some time. It\u2019s the difference between thinking about something and actually doing it. So I had been thinking about it for a long time but never actually had the courage to do it because reading Psychology and Anthropology at [University], my studies had nothing to do with design. It took a little while to push myself to go ahead and do it, but I really enjoy it.", "JD: Your sunglasses are designed in England and manufactured in Europe, so as you\u2019re getting more into the China market, has that been an advantage business-wise? That kind of Europe/UK pedigree?", "FW: Yes, I guess that is an aspect people quite like about the brand, the fact that it\u2019s made in Britain, really like a British good. The reason I actually started doing it is because it\u2019s local, and also for me, there\u2019s really not that many factories that do these things by hand. Most of the glasses and eyewear nowadays is all injection-molded and mass-produced and manufactured outside Europe. So it\u2019s actually quite rare to find something that is actually hand-made \u2014 and I like things that are hand-made by people. It\u2019s one of the reasons that it\u2019s actually done in Europe because it\u2019s local to me: I can always go to the manufacturers, to talk about design, to work together really.", "And that, luckily, is one of the bonuses. People in Japan and China love British-made goods. It has worked to my advantage, I guess.", "JD: In terms of marketing your product, what\u2019s been your most successful marketing technique so far?

Because I\u2019m based in the UK, and apart from the UK, most of my customers are based in the US and Japan and Southeast Asia, so it\u2019s all remote. [Many] people go online and search for \u201csunglasses, Asian sizes\u201d and word spread as people bought my sunglasses and liked them, then told their friends.", "I was lucky that I also went to Japan a few times through British Fashion Export, so we went to Japan and did trade shows and that was quite effective.

In those markets, which one has been your top single market so far?", "FW: I would say Japan. [In] Japan I\u2019ve got solid clientele, boutiques. US is my biggest online market. In the US, most of the customers I have are individual customers. It\u2019s quite popular especially in LA, Orange County, and New York. That\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing. We went to the States last year, just to really try to introduce the brand properly there. We got quite a bit of interest from the shops and distributors that we\u2019re negotiating with, so hopefully!", "JD:\u00a0To go back to your marketing strategy, you said that most customers right now find you based on word of mouth. I was wondering what kind of new marketing strategies you\u2019re considering. ", "FW: In London, last week, I actually had a meeting with a marketing company. But for me, my strategy will be just to grow organically. I\u2019m more interested in having a gradual sort of market strategy to get press exposure and to get distributors staged and maybe do a few launches in big cities, like Tokyo, New York, LA, Beijing, and Shanghai.", "JD: In terms of that, what\u2019s the timeline for that kind of expansion? Last year you visited the US, and you\u2019re pretty established in Japan now. What\u2019s your timeline for expanding more heavily into the China market, say Beijing or Shanghai?", "FW: China is a tough market, but it\u2019s the biggest market as well. I think the confidence level of Chinese consumers has grown as well over the last few years. So you do see a trend, especially when I went to Shanghai, of consumers slowly moving away from just big brands and designer brands and taking an interest in smaller designers, independent designers, and new designers as well. That will be quite an interesting trend to watch, so Shanghai will definitely be my first approach in mainland China.", "It\u2019s interesting to see people [in China] spending money on things that actually have been hand-made rather than just going to Louis Vuitton or Chanel. It\u2019s quite encouraging for smaller designers like myself. Hopefully, this year and next year, we\u2019ll do some launches in shops and collaborations with boutiques.", "\u00a0", ".", "JD: In looking at a China expansion strategy, are you worried about people trying to copy your designs, or is that not really on your radar right now?", "FW: Lots of people ask me about that but I think [when] people want to copy your designs, sometimes it\u2019s quite a good thing, it\u2019s something worth copying. Otherwise, it\u2019s quite encouraging: \u201cOh, people actually copying my design, it must be good!\u201d I mean, those things you just can\u2019t avoid, unfortunately. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you protect yourself. But the customers that I want are not customers who really go on the street and buy fakes for ten dollars. It\u2019s people who really want to spend money on design, the actual quality of the glasses, and the concept behind the brand. So yeah, I\u2019m not really too worried, but you know, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll really have to think about in the future, I guess.", "JD: You said you\u2019ve got your sights set on Beijing and Shanghai, but what about other markets like Hong Kong? Would you consider Hong Kong an easier market, or a harder market to enter? ", "FW: Hong Kong is probably an easier market. I\u2019m already talking to shops in Hong Kong, as well as South Korea. I think style and fashion-wise, they\u2019re a little ahead of mainland China. But you know, Shanghai and Beijing, big cities in mainland China, are catching up very quickly. Hong Kong, for me personally, will definitely be slightly easier to do business and expand in.", "JD: Brands like Chanel and Dior are so dominant in the sunglasses market in China. You\u2019ve said that you\u2019re looking for a more sophisticated consumer who wants to buy new designers, but how else do you plan on competing with these big companies in China? Is it word of mouth again? Or do you have some other plans?", "FW: I\u2019m actually not really thinking about competing with them. I think the market they\u2019re targeting and the sort of consumer I\u2019m targeting is slightly different. I can\u2019t compete with the bigger companies with big financial backing and proper adverts and advertising campaigns. For me, my brand is an independent, small brand, and it\u2019s mainly eyewear, and the quality of the glasses and how they\u2019re made are different. For me, it\u2019s more of a personal relationship that I have, this method of individual customers, buyers, or boutiques. This is a quirky, little brand, but maybe when the brand gets to a certain stage, I\u2019ll have to think about competing with bigger brands like Chanel.", "JD: For the China market, would you consider your target consumer to be the same in the Japanese market? In terms of age or profession? How do you break down your target consumer?", "FW: In Japan, [my customers] are mostly in their early 20s up to their 40s or 50s. It really depends. Some of the designs I have are quite timeless, classic and sophisticated. There are other designs that I carry that are slightly quirky and bit mad, so attractive to a younger generation and people who like quirky and interesting designs and don\u2019t mind actually going on the street wearing mad designs. It\u2019s slightly different, my designs are quite wide-ranging. In Japan, it sells to a quite younger generation to 40s and 50s. In China, I\u2019m anticipating it will be the same, sort of, the young and stylish generation.", "But eyewear is interesting because it\u2019s not like clothing or shoes. It\u2019s really what personality you have. Maybe people in their mid 40s or 50s can still get away with wearing some bright color shades, or big frames, so it really depends on people\u2019s tastes.", "Fei Wang Hollywood, \u00a3205 / $350 (2286 RMB)", "JD: What\u2019s your most popular design? Do you have one single one that you just find is the one everyone wants? ", "FW: There are a couple of designs that seem to be selling very well. One of them is called the \u201cHollywood\u201d \u2014 maybe the name is attractive. The other one is \u201cPeony.\u201d Those two shades are my most popular designs.", "JD: And those are kind of classic designs?", "FW: Yes, quite classic, with round edges. I guess it\u2019s a bit soft, quite feline shaped and soft. Some girls don\u2019t really like square frames, or really round frames, so those are the two frames that are kind of in-between. Very classic.", "JD: It seems that the Word-of-Mouth marketing plan you\u2019ve got has worked very well for some companies in China.", "FW: Yeah, especially with the Internet and social networks. I think it\u2019s very powerful. I would say that people trust their friends and people that they know when they suggest, \u201cYou should go on this site, you should see her glasses.\u201d You trust them, instead of people always being worried when they see television adverts and [the product] looks too good to be true. So for me, word of mouth is has been very good, and it\u2019s actually a really good marketing strategy for smaller brands.", "JD: We\u2019re really fascinated with your company because we\u2019ve been closely watching the increasing sophistication of consumers in the biggest cities in China, how many of them are not just plastering themselves in logos anymore.", "FW: Absolutely, and in China it\u2019s such a huge population. It\u2019s not even just in China, but in the whole world, you are seeing people react against over-produced and over-manufactured things. They want something that is special, they want something that they know that not that many people out there are wearing.", "So it\u2019s always about individuality, and it\u2019s very good to see that craftsmanship and hand-made things are coming back into fashion.", "Special thanks to Fei Wang for taking the time to speak to Jing Daily.

The channeling of China\u2019s savings into \u201dstores of value,\u201d like gold or vacant real estate, that are themselves unproductive but offer people a place to stash their cash given a limited choice of alternatives. I\u2019ve noted many times the central role this factor plays in fueling China\u2019s property market. I\u2019ve also noted how, when the government stepped in with \u201ccooling measures\u201d to rein in real estate speculation, plenty of Chinese investors switched from property to gold, which served much the same need. The rising price of jade suggests, not surprisingly, that it is also playing a similar function.", "2. Asset inflation, due to the large amounts of newly-created money sloshing around in the Chinese economy. China\u2019s money supply expanded by over 30% last year (year on year) and nearly 20% again this year, yet economists are scratching their heads why this has not shown up in consumer inflation (at least according to official staistics, which has August CPI at 3.5%). I\u2019ve argued that the excess money has been going mainly into savings rather than consumption, bidding up prices in real estate, gold, and (now apparently) jade, hence the latest rise in jade prices.", "3. The role of unreported \u201cgrey income\u201d in China\u2019s economy. A recent report by Wang Xiaolu of the China Reform Foundation, published by Credit Suisse, has attracted a great deal of attention by claiming that wealthy Chinese have US$1.5 trillion in hidden income (accounting for over 30% of GDP), presumably derived from bribes, kickbacks, or tax evasion. Portable, non-traceable assets like gold and jade are an ideal form of storing such gains \u2013 far better than bank accounts, which can be traced and confiscated, or real estate, which to avoid scrutiny would have to be registered and held through relatives or other nominees. If Wang\u2019s study is accurate, no wonder the market for jade is booming.", "Chovanec\u2019s observations are both timely and can be applied to any type of portable asset, whether it\u2019s gold or jade jewelry or a rare Patek Philippe watch, a case of \u201982 Lafite, or artwork by blue-chip Chinese artists like\u00a0Liu Ye, Zao Wou-Ki or Yue Minjun. As Jing Daily has pointed out regularly over the past year, many Chinese collectors at auction know little about wine or art, yet they\u2019re looking to stash their cash \u2014 whether legitimately accrued or not \u2014 into non-RMB-denominated assets that will sidestep Chinese inflation and be sold later to a buyer who\u2019ll be paying with a stronger yuan. This phenomenon goes far beyond jade.", "To paraphrase Chovanec\u2019s conclusion, it\u2019s no wonder that the art, antique, jewelry, watch and wine markets are booming as well.", "Qeelin's opened its first Shanghai boutique this summer", "So who, aside from Xinjiang jade dealers or major auction houses, stands to benefit from the jade boom? In our opinion, some of the biggest beneficiaries \u2014 given jade continues to catch on not only among those looking to \u201cstash their cash\u201d but also with China\u2019s younger, more fashionable generation \u2014 may be home-grown jewelry brands like Qeelin or Zhaoyi, whose collections heavily feature the use of jade.", "As Jing Daily wrote earlier this summer, unlike China\u2019s upstart luxury fashion or automotive brands \u2014 which must compete directly with established brands from Europe, North America and Japan \u2014 jade-heavy jewelry brands can actually benefit from their \u201cmade in China\u201d status.", "Much like Shang Xia, Hermes\u2019 new Chinese sub-brand, brands like Qeelin are actively marketing Chinese jade design and craftsmanship.

While most Chinese brands that are looking to establish themselves globally struggle with the issue of pedigree \u2014 mainland China was, after all, without any real \u201cbrands\u201d for most of the 20th century, and had few to speak of in the pre-revolution era \u2014 jade has a built-in heritage of thousands of years, tied closely together with centuries of Chinese history.", "Though a Chinese jewelry brand may be less than 20 years old \u2014 or even less than five years old \u2014 giving jade a central role in its brand image can weave in a rich historical narrative that established diamond, gold or platinum-focused brands can\u2019t match.", "The second trait that gives jade an edge over the competition in the jewelry market is its indisputable \u201cChinese-ness.\u201d Having been used for ornamental purposes in modern-day China since neolithic times, over the past several thousand years jade and jadeite have developed a resonance in Chinese culture comparable to gold and diamonds in India and the West. Despite a relative preference for diamonds and imported jewelry brands in China since the economic reforms of the late 1970s, and the country\u2019s economic lockdown of 1949-1979, for roughly 5,000 continuous years jade was the precious stone of choice for China\u2019s elite, becoming a distinctively \u201cChinese\u201d stone despite its existence in other parts of the world, most notably in Central America. After around 1800, jade was joined by its rarer and more expensive counterpart jadeite (the majority of which is mined in modern-day Myanmar), yet both remained highly popular throughout the remainder of the Qing Dynasty.", "Although many jewelry buyers in China at the high-end are less concerned with history or culture and more with flash, brand name and price tag, the rising ubiquity of Western-style diamond-heavy jewelry in the China market will likely see luxury trendsetters looking to jade and more China-infused designs in coming years \u2014 but we might not see this until the \u201cpost-80s generation\u201d really starts to have an impact on the China luxury market.", "However, we\u2019re already seeing jade and jadeite creeping into the Chinese luxury mainstream. From the jade accents on the limited-edition, China-only\u00a0Ferrari 599 HGTE to upstart fashion houses sewing jade buttons onto China-inspired designs, to the Sino-French jewelry brand Qeelin\u2018s recent \u201cTien Di\u201d collection, China\u2019s imperial stone is finally coming into its own again after a long absence. Earlier this year, Zhaoyi Jade (\u662d\u4eea\u7fe0\u5c4b) became the first Asian company to join established international brands like Cartier, Patek Philippe, Vertu and Zegna at Shanghai\u2019s swish Bund 18, a restored neo-classical building designed in 1923 by the British architectural firm Palmer & Turner.", "While these developments may not necessarily constitute a \u201ctrend\u201d in themselves, the growing presence of jade in designs by Chinese fashion or jewelry companies, along with the popularity of jade and jadeite among Chinese collectors at auction hints that these stones might be the best shortcut these Chinese brands have to compete on a global scale while tapping the existing demand of collectors and enthusiasts at home.", "Tweet", "document.write('<iframe  frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?url=%url%&#038;appkey=&#038;type=6\" width=\"86\" height=\"16\"></iframe>'.replace(/%url%/,encodeURIComponent(location.href)));"]}, {"title": "Dispatch From Paris: China\u2019s European Textile Crusade", "meta": "September 13, 2010", "paragraphs": ["Premiere Vision 2010, taking part in the northern suburbs of Paris this week", "China\u2019s rise on the global stage isn\u2019t only being felt in Asia or North America \u2014 far from it.

Although their presence is still very limited, we\u2019re likely to see an ever-increasing number of Chinese textile manufacturers continuing their \u201cEuropean textile crusade\u201d as the Chinese economy continues to grow.

Backlogs may take several months or quarters to resolve themselves.", "Meanwhile, the travel industry all over the world is coming to a standstill. With air travel restrictions, canceled conferences, and more employees working remotely, the demand for travel is plummeting in an unprecedented way.

Therefore, applying similar responses from past pandemics won\u2019t work.", "However, some important lessons can be learned. Look at the 2008 market crisis, for example. That year, as I was finishing my Ph.D. in luxury strategy and publishing my first book, the world experienced one of the most severe economic recessions in history.

It\u2019s surprising how few companies have a dedicated value creation process in place.", "Most managers cannot verbalize what drives the value of their brands compared to what their closest competitors deliver.

All sports cars should have \u201cperformance,\u201d so it can\u2019t be a differentiator for a single brand.

Luxury is all about extreme value creation. No consumer will buy a luxury brand if the price seems too high, and when it seems too high, that means the price is exceeding the brand\u2019s perceived value.", "Luxury brands\u2019 number one task is to create extreme value. I find that value in luxury is not connected to products and features \u2014 it\u2019s connected to brands. The product is important (design, quality, materials, craftsmanship, etc.) but the main value driver in luxury is Added Luxury Value (ALV), which is the result of tangible and intangible effects that people intuitively connect to a luxury brand. ALV is driven by a brand\u2019s equity rather than its product features \u2014 even in engineer-driven categories such as the luxury car industry.", "Some of those ALV drivers are expected deliverables such as social status. Others are what I call \u201chidden drivers\u201d of luxury value \u2014 attributes like social protection. For example, a famous luxury hotel has a whole floor dedicated to patients who just came out of plastic surgery. The guests (many of whom are well-known celebrities) enter the hotel through a secret and dedicated security-protected entrance and are transported to the floor via a separate elevator so no other guest will ever see them. There\u2019s also a medical team on duty 24/7 to service them if they need assistance. They stay there until they have healed so that even their staff won\u2019t know that they\u2019ve had a procedure upon their return \u2014 all while they stay protected from the paparazzi. While they\u2019re at the hotel, they spend an enormous sum but not for the room. They are paying for a hidden driver of ALV: public protection.", "Pricing mistakes are common in luxury and are one of the biggest culprits behind value destruction.", "Similarly, the creative director for an iconic fashion brand told me that discretion (hence public protection) is the main value driver for his high-end clientele rather than the fashion items themselves. If he was ever to disclose the names of his best clients, they would go elsewhere.", "Because of this, ALV needs to be managed as rigorously as brands manage their product portfolios or their marketing budgets. Since ALV is mostly intangible and perceived intuitively, managing it incorrectly can destroy all ALV. If this happens, brands can\u2019t create the extreme value needed to support their high prices. When a luxury brand fails, it\u2019s usually because it wasn\u2019t able to create, sustain, and grow ALV over time.", "Pricing mistakes are common in luxury and are one of the biggest culprits behind value destruction. One common mistake \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 is pricing a brand too low. This happens because managers aren\u2019t fully aware of the Added Luxury Value they create. Instead of pricing for value, they set prices based on production costs or against the competition\u2019s prices. They feel that this makes for a \u201csafe bet.\u201d But what if this leads to incorrect pricing?", "Intuition doesn\u2019t help. A famous restaurant served an omelet for $1,000. Intuitively, that price sounds expensive \u2014 even excessive \u2014 for one dish. The restaurant\u2019s rationale is that it\u2019s worth the sum of its ingredients (in that case caviar) among other reasons. This is a typical example of cost-based pricing. If the ingredients are $600 and the brand wants to get to a certain profit margin, they might price the product at $1,000. Managers feel safe with this rationale because it comes from tangible things.", "What they forget, though, is that luxury is not the sum of tangible features \u2014 it comes from intangible ALV created by their brand. When I measured the ALV of the omelet with my luxury pricing tool, the Luxury Index, I found that the omelet\u2019s ALV was far exceeding the price the restaurant charged. $2,000 or higher was the appropriate price. When I confronted the restaurant years ago with my findings, they felt that increasing the price would collapse the demand, and they opted against a price hike.", "Years later, the price of caviar skyrocketed, and the restaurant was forced to increase the omelet\u2019s prices. Yet at $2,000 \u2014 the price I had initially recommended based on ALV measurements \u2014 the omelet sold more units than ever before to the surprise of the management team. That\u2019s because the price now better reflects the omelet\u2019s true ALV. But unfortunately, the restaurant lost almost a decade of profit opportunity as they could have sold many more units at drastically higher profitability. The positive impact of increasing the price of an omelet from $1,000 to $2,000 shows that cost-based pricing destroys value since fewer people bought the omelet at its lower price. Intuition in luxury pricing is wrong. Instead, luxury brands must measure and understand ALV, so they can price correctly.", "Pricing brand products because competitors price their products at a certain level is similarly dangerous. This method assumes that a brand creates the same ALV in a category that their main competitors do, which is rare if not inconceivable. But what this pricing method also does is to signal to consumers that the brand is not more valuable than its competitors. With this approach, they set a wrong reference price and ruin perceived value if that price is too low.\u00a0 And after that price is set, corrections are difficult.", "Pricing mistakes always confuse consumers. They position a brand into a competitive set, as the price is the easiest signal to understand and compare. A mismatch between ALV and pricing will lead to confusion, uncertainty, and fewer sales. It\u2019s the single biggest profit destroyer and reason luxury brands go out of business. The CEO of one of the most luxurious shoe brands in the world recently acknowledged that \u2014 after learning the ALV in his category \u2014 that his shoes should be priced ten times higher. Yet, since he launched his brand at prices that are \u201ctoo low\u201d (but comparable with other luxury shoe brands), it will be a challenge to correct his pricing architecture. The damage has been done \u2014 with immediate revenue and profit implications.", "Yield-management is another common value-destroying tool in luxury. It has become popular in the luxury hospitality and airline industries (including shared private jet services that have fluctuating prices based on demand). Hence, if an airline seat is not sold, the airline may sell it last-minute at a lower price. Similarly, many luxury hotels use dynamic pricing to sell their room inventory when demand is lower. From a consumer perspective, this destroys value and creates confusion. If a consumer pays $1,500 for a suite one week but learns the price is only $500 the following week, they will feel ripped off. Or if they paid $500 one week, but the hotel asks for $1,500 the next, a consumer won\u2019t stay there again because the perceived value was initially set at $500. While dynamic pricing can make sense for highly commoditized products, it destroys value in the luxury space. Always remember: Consumers don\u2019t pay for the product (hotel room, airline seat, handbag, etc.), they pay for perceived ALV. Dynamic pricing will always confuse consumers and has a major impact on a brand\u2019s extreme value perception.", "Luxury pricing is one of the weak spots for most brands I assess. Just because others are making the same mistakes, that doesn\u2019t mean a luxury brand should continue to do what\u2019s always done. A mismatch between ALV and price will always impact brand perception and weaken a brand\u2019s equity over time, and incongruent pricing within a portfolio further weakens a brand.", "Pricing requires the same meticulous management as all other aspects. Because of its visibility and strong signal, pricing mistakes can destroy a brand faster than other brand management mistakes. Still, surprisingly little attention is paid to pricing.

As a case in point, the speed with which Chinese consumers lost confidence in Dolce & Gabbana because of a series of communication mistakes shows how badly brands need to have access to real-time information about how consumers are viewing them.

But then I asked, \u201chow many of you can tell me right now, how your brand is trending in the last hour, how consumers see you right now, and how your social media is currently driving sales?\u201d Not one hand rose.", "This example highlights a paradox: Top managers of luxury brands need relevant information, but they don\u2019t have it. Most brands do indeed have social media listening tools, but in most cases, they are completely useless. That\u2019s because most of these tools can\u2019t identify the deep connections between a brand\u2019s data points. Listening isn\u2019t enough. What top managers also need is real-time analytics about what\u2019s going on with their brand. And real-time means now, not in a month, or a week from now.", "That\u2019s why I always recommend the most advanced digital data querying and analytics tools that run on extremely sophisticated machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence engines.

For one luxury car brand, 80-90 percent of its digital communications had no relevance at all to its consumers.", "Traditional social listening tools indicated that the brand had received a high amount of likes and garnered some other metrics that sounded reassuring. However, the brand was not effective in influencing consumers. While people liked the brand\u2019s posts, its content didn\u2019t change anything in the way people communicate about the brand. This one-directional messaging was unable to activate or engage the target audience.", "Even worse, as a result of the brand\u2019s ineffective communication, competitors were easily able to occupy the luxury car brand\u2019s desired positioning space in the minds of consumers. The result was millions of dollars in advertising investment wasted while competitors took the lead in the luxury car category.", "Another example: After looking at a high-level consumer event for a luxury brand, it was discovered that most of the event\u2019s communications were happening among company employees rather than consumers. The event became just another lost opportunity as well as an inefficient use of a marketing budget.", "Why does this matter? In practically all luxury categories, there\u2019s a lot of fluidity between digital and physical realms. Even for high-involvement categories like luxury cars, luxury beauty, or luxury fashion, consumers build their preferences across all touchpoints, and digital becomes an important tool for shaping perceptions.

But in today\u2019s digital reality, brands have to make sense of all their digital communications, especially when addressing millennials and Gen Zers. Cyber-luxury is a closed loop that\u2019s built around consumers.

That was what made a brand luxury in the eyes of consumers. But fast-forward to 2030, and many luxury cars will be electric, self-driving, and more attuned to the sharing economy. In the future, cars will become entertainment, workspace, and comfort vehicles, and the rules of the luxury car game will need to be rewritten. As always, when technologies shift, new players emerge to shake up the status quo by doing things differently \u2014 a lesson that many established premium and luxury brands have already learned from Tesla. Given the focus in China on electric cars, it will only be a matter of time until Chinese luxury car brands become relevant both inside and outside of China, putting additional pressure on incumbent brands to redefine their business models.", "These examples can be extended to practically any luxury category. No product is \u201csafe\u201d from technological disruption, and Asian consumers are not only embracing that disruption, but they\u2019re also expecting brands to be at the forefront of technology. One difficulty for incumbent brands is that the technologies of the future are completely different from the technologies of the past. Hence, completely new skillsets are needed. Areas in which a brand previously had expertise might not be relevant at all in the future. A lack of internal capabilities that stems from having been invested in outmoded technologies for too long will endanger many existing luxury brands.", "While brands must technologically transform, brand storytelling also has to evolve drastically. When technologies shift, consumers will not necessarily care about traditional players anymore. The fate of Blackberry, Nokia, Kodak, Polaroid, IBM, and many others should be a warning for today\u2019s leading brands that feel safer than they should. Consumers, especially demanding young ones, want to know the story behind the brand. They expect luxury brands to shape their industries, not to wait and see where things go and adapt later. Innovation combined with powerful brand storytelling was never as important as today, and it is already a major weakness for many existing luxury brands.", "Technology shifts will be a huge opportunity for companies that embrace them and make them a competitive advantage. The art is to combine new technologies with brand storytelling to create extreme value. The magnitude of disruption has made luxury markets more attractive than ever before while also more challenging than in the past.

Decisions on which experience to offer are often made in the boardroom without real consumer insights. As a result, many brands make assumptions about what consumers want instead of knowing what they want. Very few brands are excellent in putting the consumer\u2019s needs at the center of their actions. \u201cConsumer-centric\u201d is still very much a buzzword, and a decade from now, brands that don\u2019t provide a relevant luxury experience for customers simply won\u2019t survive.", "I often hear that what sets luxury brands apart is the personal experience consumers have in the store, assuming it\u2019s a fashion or lifestyle brand, a hotel or restaurant, or a car dealership. When I audit those brand experiences and benchmark them against their competitors in the same space, there\u2019s often a recurring pattern: The experiences hardly differ at all. One space may be a bit nicer than another or the architecture may be more spectacular, but that isn\u2019t enough to create an authentic, relevant, unique, or memorable luxury experience.", "If a brand story isn\u2019t clear, sharply-defined, and highly-different in its positioning elements, then turning the brand expression into an experience will never work.", "For this to happen, brands need to start gathering data long before they come up with experiences. To be distinct means creating experiences that are perceivably different from those that other luxury brands create, and this starts by defining the brand. If a brand story isn\u2019t clear, sharply-defined, and highly-different in its positioning elements, then turning the brand expression into an experience will never work. It also won\u2019t feel authentic because authenticity requires a strong connection to a brand\u2019s purpose and values. Not enough clarity or definition in brand equity and brand storytelling is a major shortcoming for most luxury brands.", "The other issue is creating memorable experiences. When I think about the times that brands have created a memorable experience for me, they are few and far between (yes, even in the luxury industry). When scrutinizing an array of stores belonging to leading luxury fashion and leather goods brands, their stores reminded me more of a department store than a refined, high-class, luxury experience. Not once was I offered something that made my shopping experience feel special, and in all cases, interactions with store staff felt rushed. None of the experiences were convincing, memorable (in a positive way), or created any sort of brand equity. It was quite the opposite: I would never return to most of those brand stores if I had been on a real-world shopping experience.", "The same happened during my recent audits of luxury sports car brands in Asia. In one case, the experience of visiting one of the most admired European luxury car brands in the world was so negative (due to the arrogant behavior of a salesperson), I left the dealership in a state of shock. Meanwhile, during a recent stay at a luxury hotel, I had an important question that needed clarifying before I arrived but wasn\u2019t able to get ahold of any on staff for hours. In the end, the hotel made a typical error for a luxury brand by forcing a guest to move from one place (check-in) to another (concierge) because the staff couldn\u2019t perform certain duties. From a customer perspective, this creates burden and frustration instead of a luxurious experience. This is the unfortunate reality for many luxury brands in 2020, as their experiences are still too transactional, too beholden to industry standards, and not nearly personal or memorable enough.", "This won\u2019t be acceptable by 2030 because the youngest generation has higher expectations than any before it, and young millennials and Gen Zers will force brands to think, act, and behave very differently. In China, where luxury consumers are now, on average, about 15 to 20 years younger than they are in Europe and the US, this effect can already be seen. Many Western brands are already seeing that what\u2019s accepted in other parts of the world isn\u2019t sufficient for young, highly-demanding Chinese customers, and a large number of brands are struggling in China because they can\u2019t create brand equity and loyalty over time. Yet, what they\u2019re seeing in China now is just a preview of what they\u2019ll experience everywhere else in the world in the future after today\u2019s youngest consumers assume control of the market.", "One important aspect of Gen Zers is that luxury, in both expression and expectation, is a much more personal and unique affair for them than it was for previous generations. Hyper-competition will be a big driver of this market. The number of brands in every segment will double, or even triple, and more and better Asia-born luxury brands will emerge to focus on more specific aspects of luxury than we find with today\u2019s brands. Altogether, there will be much more for consumers to choose from, which will lead to even more individual expressions of luxury. The principles of luxury will remain, but the expressions and expectations will multiply.", "What will brands have to do? Closeness to consumers will become much more critical. Digital is a huge enabler for luxury brands, and, in the future, they must have a digital infrastructure with sophisticated CRM systems and advanced data querying technologies. Most importantly, their data needs to be readily available for decision-makers on every level. If someone checks in to a hotel, for instance, the front desk staff should know the guest\u2019s preferences beforehand, and they should have a relevant, tailored experience strategy prepared for them when they arrive. If a guest has a day packed full of meetings, the hotel should offer an evening of a workout with a personal trainer followed by a light meal to help create a \u201cluxury\u201d experience. For a vacationing guest, they should offer luxury in the form of memorable local experiences. Each person and situation is different. The future of luxury will be about creating experiences that consider those differences \u2014 in a memorable, shareable, and consumer-centric way.", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm\u00a0\u00c9quit\u00e9,\u00a0and the professor of luxury strategy and extreme value creation at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.

By 2030 consumers will look for something different: they will look for brands that tell a story they want to be associated with. Hence, the elements of the brand story become decisive in consumer value creation. These include social, environmental, and cultural factors. Not surprisingly, in line with shifting expectations of young consumers, sustainability and social consciousness will be much more important than today.", "As consumers look for personal imagine content, brands will be expected to deliver things people can talk about and share. The luxury store of the future will be instagrammable, will offer surprising elements that intrigue people and motivate them to share their experiences. Young consumers will expect drastically more inspiration from brands rather than the rather transactional interactions most luxury brands offer today. This will change everything.", "Imagine a luxury hotel \u2014 a spectacular lobby, an outstanding spa, an inviting room, and a great restaurant will be all expected in the future, with these amenities already built into the room price. In the future, however, differentiation will come through highly personalized customer experiences that match their lifestyles. If someone does yoga, they will expect the hotel to arrange private classes for them in spaces that allow the creation of sharable moments. If someone likes art, they will expect an expert to accompany them to visit local galleries and museums. Personal shoppers will accompany customers to local shops and arrange private showings. Some of these services already exist, but in the future, they will be mission critical to achieve both differentiation and extreme value creation. Individualized concierge experiences will replace the pre-defined, rather generic service \u201cmenus\u201d so common everywhere today.", "When consumers want brands to represent who they are, it will become a matter of survival for them to understand these deep insights. To achieve this, some of the most advanced luxury brands already use A.I., artificial intelligence technologies, to create a snapshot of sentiment and preferences of consumers. In the future, this will not only be standard, but the ability to obtain real-time consumer insights in way that it leads to actionable consumer insights will separate successful from unsuccessful brands. The future of luxury brand management will be the fusion of A.I.-powered advanced data querying methods with personalized, highly inspirational content, services, and products to create highly relevant, unique, and authentic brands.", "The uniqueness and authenticity of brands will become significantly more important in the future as consumers use them as to create their own curated self-image. If a brand does not have the coolness factor customers expect, it\u2019s exchangeable with other brands. If a brand does not feel authentic, then it can no longer support their customer\u2019s curation efforts. As a result, brands have to take a position, represent strong values, and define themselves through the eyes of consumers. If I look at typical brand positionings in our brand audits, I mostly find brand definitions that are inwardly focused. The consumer is often missing. This is a mistake already today. In the future, it will be deadly.", "2030 will be exciting for brands who understand their role in the life of customers.

The answer is simple: Those brands create at least the same amount of value as the prices they charge. If a customer is willing to spend $4,000 for a Louis Vuitton or Gucci handbag or $5,000 for a Cartier ring, then those prices are the perceived values of those brands. Yes: The bag or ring\u2019s design and materials are contributing factors to their prices, but the majority of an object\u2019s value is created by the brand, not by the product\u2019s functional value or its features. Still, many brands focus predominantly on products and neglect to build brand equity. And while some might have been able to get away with that over the last decade, they won\u2019t be able to in the next one.", "The past few years have already shown a clear tendency towards ultra-premiumization, which will help push average brands out of business even faster. The average prices of the leading luxury brands in every category have significantly increased, and there\u2019s been an emergence of new brands and product lines offered at dramatically higher price points than we\u2019ve ever witnessed before. If you look at the beauty care segment, for example, the sheer number of brands priced above $500 for their main items has skyrocketed, and this was a price point that seemed unreachable just a few years ago. The lesson? When brands offer enough perceived value, consumers are willing to pay for it.", "This trend is only going to increase. The cost and complexity of market entry for new brands have decreased dramatically thanks to digital channels, which is leading to an unprecedented increase in competition \u2014 even at the highest end of the luxury market. While there were few top-end brands available in the past, we will see many by 2030, and they\u2019ll come from all over the world. Chinese luxury brands will conquer the global market and challenge Western brands, as they\u2019ll be much better prepared for the needs of Chinese luxury customers than their Western counterparts. In ten years, when over 50 percent of global luxury consumption will come from China or Chinese customers purchasing abroad, neglecting the quickly-evolving needs of Chinese customers will be costly. To reach them, real-time insights into their conversations, preferences, and needs from advanced A.I.-powered analysis is needed, and in the future, those insights will be an absolute must.", "The only way to gain, maintain, or extend a competitive advantage by the new reality of 2030 will be to focus on brand equity building, which includes defining the brand\u2019s purpose. This sounds trivial or like it should be easy, but in reality, most brands are incredibly weak at describing or expressing their purpose. Very few brands were clear about their purpose during our recent brand audits. At best, they had a vague idea, but one that rarely translated into tangible customer benefits. A lot of brand definitions today are merely self-descriptive. In other words, the brands talk about themselves rather than the value they create for their customers.", "Even worse, if a value definition does exist, it often gets lost during customer interactions. For instance, I audited the shopping experiences of several top luxury leather goods brands last week, and the results were eye-opening: All the experiences felt the same, regardless of the brand. Despite being filled with customers before the holidays, their stores felt more like cheap warehouses than a luxury experience, with long waits and no refreshments served. There was nothing special about the purchase situation, and these are the top luxury brands in the entire world! These types of experiences simply won\u2019t be accepted in luxury by 2030.", "With the continued rise of Chinese customers, the average age of luxury consumption will drastically decrease. Young millennials and Gen Zers will account for the majority of luxury consumption in ten years, and women will be the most important gender in making purchase decisions. These customers expect brands that resonate with them and know their preferences. Having a beautiful product won\u2019t be enough. The purpose of the brand is what will matter most. What are the values of the brand? Is the brand true to its values? Or, are the values just on paper? Social media will only increase transparency further, and young, digitally savvy consumers will know quickly if brands are b.s.ing them or if they\u2019re authentic and purposeful.", "What would I recommend brands do as they head into the 2020s? Audit your brand. Be critical and ask the right questions. Don\u2019t settle for anything less than a sharp brand definition and ensure that your brand\u2019s purpose is clear. Then, train your team on what luxury means in the 2020s. Even with the best brands, there is often a gap in knowledge when managing luxury in a purposeful way for millennials and Gen Zers. Critically question the customer journey: Do you bring your brand purpose across each customer interaction? Does your staff know which role they have in creating a purposeful brand experience?", "In luxury, you can\u2019t afford any gaps. One red flag in the customer journey experience can sufficiently destroy a lifelong customer relationship, and in 2030, the stakes will be much higher.

Yet those millennials are now the top group for luxury purchases worldwide, particularly in China, and that is threatening many brands\u2019 existence.

Their rite of passage won\u2019t be their first car \u2014 it will be their first smartphone. Their life is entirely digital, and many Gen Zers are already tired of sharing their life on Snapchat or generating content for Instagram. No generation has ever felt so much pressure to share moments, talk about them, and receive social confirmation. I sometimes call them the \u201ccontent creation\u201d generation, the first generation to experience a lifestyle that\u2019s about social currency, social scores, and social recognition. This creates pressure and the desire to \u201cescape,\u201d and the role of luxury is to offer escapes.", "This is why branded experiences become more important than anything else. For previous generations, luxury brands could get away with flawed experiences as long as they could make consumers believe that their quality, craftsmanship, and heritage was better than the rest. Those times are over. Quality is simply expected now, and consumers know that whatever is the latest technology today will be replaced by something better in less than a year. That leaves experiences as the area for a competitive advantage. In 2030, when Gen Zers will account for the largest chunk of luxury spending, the ability to create a differentiating experience for that group will determine the fate of brands and companies.", "Experience creation requires completely different skills than what most brands were traditionally excellent at. It requires a much more holistic approach where the customer is in the center of all strategies. Today\u2019s companies are mostly product-driven rather than story-driven. Companies of the future have to build a strong brand story first and then create branded experiences from that story. Looking at today\u2019s leading luxury brands, only a handful are fully prepared for this challenge. Radically different approaches will be necessary.", "First, brands must adapt to their fast-changing consumer insights. As the speed of change will accelerate exponentially, classic market research will completely lose relevance, and real-time insight generation technologies will take over. Artificial Intelligence will evolve from a buzzword to a minimum necessity, and the ability to make sense of millions of data points will be the difference between success and failure. This is the competitive advantage of the future.", "Second, insights need to lead to much faster and more precise actions compared to what brands do today. They need to generate relevant content that is authentic because content may change by the day or even by the hour. Therefore, precise branding and brand storytelling must improve drastically. Rarely is a brand\u2019s story precise enough today, and by 2030, imprecise brand storytelling will make brands obsolete. Many established brands will not survive the transition to Generation Z, as they will have to compete with a lot of new, Gen-Z-focused brands. Initially, these might be indie or niche brands, but over time the sheer volume of these new brands will change the game. As they are born, they\u2019ll come with new ideas, and many could originate from China to conquer the luxury world from China.

In fact, it\u2019s still hard to find luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Chanel at discounted prices, and finding their sales periods advertised on social media is unthinkable because even when these brands have promotions, they don\u2019t advertise them, and instead, reserve them for an elite group of buyers.", "Givenchy and Tao Liang (a.k.a.

Different from the relatively fixed social media matrix of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in Western countries, new Chinese platforms continuously re-engage Chinese users, particularly millennials and Gen Zers. Words, images, videos, and live-streaming have had to adapt to each different platform. WeChat is suitable for influencers who are talented at writing stories, while Weibo encourages and supports influencers to post short videos. The process of attracting followers and driving online traffic is time-consuming, and traffic usually sticks to platforms in particular ways. Thus, the transition from one to another is a challenge for influencers.", "The popularity of short videos and live-streaming has contributed to the Li Jiaqi \u201ccult.\u201d His emotive rhetoric, which easily provokes viewers into buying products, can only be realized through video format.

As livestreaming on Douyin, Kuaishou, and Taobao has become popular with users in lower-tier cities, top-tier consumers don\u2019t tend to keep up with new livestreamers, as they don\u2019t spend hours watching livestreams. This elite group of consumers also presents a greater desire for individuality \u2014 as well as fatigue for mainstream brands \u2014 and now their craving for \u201cniche\u201d content has spread to the types of KOLs they prefer.

In fact, most people discuss AI without really understanding it or what the benefits are.", "First off, one must know that AI is just a small part of what I call advanced data querying technologies. These technologies also include machine learning and advanced data analytics. AI is part of a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure that I suggest all brands implement. An advanced digital toolset is the game-changer for managing luxury brands. In my view, it\u2019s not optional \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity for luxury brands to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market environment.", "The frameworks in which brands operate have never evolved faster. Think about the beauty industry. A few years ago, large brands dominated the beauty market and mainly used classic above-the-line advertising to build brand awareness. But with the emergence of young, digitally savvy customers like Gen Zers (those nearing the age of 20 now) and young millennials (consumers below 30 at this time), the interest in more niche brands has increased significantly. As a single brand, smaller players may not be a threat to the large brands, but combined, they already take a significant market share and do a much better job at creating purpose, relevance, and authenticity for younger customers.", "In other luxury markets, we see trends shifting fast. We will see a dramatic shift in the luxury car sector over the next five years towards electrification, and the industry leaders will be new, technology-driven brands who play a different game than traditional brands. This has enormous disruption potential and puts many traditional business models at risk. In luxury handbags and fashion, there have never been such diverse offerings as now, both in terms of brands and items. For consumers, there were never more choices, and they\u2019re dealing with more complexity than ever before.", "Meanwhile, a never-ending influx of influencers and key opinion leaders (KOLs) is assuming the role of providing customers with information and guidance. China is setting the benchmark in this industry, but other countries are following. And in this world of complexity, change, and ever-increasing digital brand access, luxury brand managers and top executives need tools to help them make better decisions. This is where advanced data querying methods that use AI become indispensable.", "Managers say to me, \u201cWe already have social media listening. Why do we need more?\u201d To that, I say, \u201cHow often did you use it to make a critical strategic decision?\u201d If the answer is zero, which is usually the case, then that infrastructure isn\u2019t used enough. Brands need tools that provide automated real-time information about brand sentiment. In my view, this is the next best thing to a customer brain implant, as the most advanced technologies allow brands to follow what consumers are expressing about the brand in an automated fashion. It\u2019s not simply to have this data but to make sense of it \u2014 and help steer your brand with it. This is where digital transformation becomes so mission-critical. Few companies are using its full potential now, but in an increasingly digital world, there is no better advantage.", "Knowing who influences your brand", "Three very basic questions I have for brand managers is who are your key influencers, what messages are they sending, and who are they influencing. I am always surprised at how little information many brands have in response. Given the growing importance of influencers \u2014 especially in the Chinese social shopping environment \u2014 a brand\u2019s ability to monitor and manage those influencers is indispensable. AI can identify and structure complex communication patterns and provide a real-time view of who the most important people who communicate positive messages about your brand are, or conversely if some people send messages that deteriorate your brand image. It also helps to understand competitive dynamics and generate insights about competing brands.", "Identify communication strategies, content, and priorities", "It\u2019s striking to me how many brands communicate without knowing what its target group is talking about at that moment. The assumption that consumer preferences are stable is completely wrong. For instance, we noticed that one brand\u2019s specific digital advertising message was 500 percent more effective at a certain hour on a specific weekday than it was than just one hour earlier. The same goes for brand content. If topics are trending among target consumers, a slight modification of the message can yield dramatic effects. Doing any advertising without advanced digital tools is wasting money and making the brand weaker, especially compared to competitors that deploy those technologies already.", "Making the right decisions", "Most importantly, an AI-based digital infrastructure helps brands to make data-driven decisions instead of gut-feeling decisions. An iconic luxury car brand was convinced of the way they thought their customers saw them \u2014 but it was really the way they wanted them to see the brand. To management\u2019s surprise, AI and machine learning showed them that their experience-based belief was completely wrong. It also showed them how two competitors were better-positioned to lure customers away thanks to more precise messaging on core brand elements.

Below I\u2019ve highlighted five important China luxury trends, how they\u2019re disrupting the luxury industry, and how brands can master them. This is relevant for all luxury brands, including fashion, food & beverages, lifestyle, and service categories. These trends are changing the way luxury brands must play the game to stay relevant.", "Trend #1: Young, digitally savvy, female customers", "The luxury market is booming in China, but the profile of those consumers differs greatly from those in most other markets. For instance, around the world, more than 55 percent of luxury goods are purchased by customers who are over 40. But in China, this number is less than 20 percent (younger customers purchase the vast majority of luxury goods there, with a sweet spot between the ages of 25 and 30.) To address these younger segments, brands have to think much younger and target customers in their mid to late teens.", "Another demographic setting China apart shows that most of the country\u2019s luxury consumers are women. Depending on the city, between 75 and 78 percent of Chinese luxury consumption comes from female consumers. And if you include gifts by men for women to this number, the Chinese luxury market looks even more overwhelmingly woman-oriented.\u00a0 And all of these consumers prefer to access brands digitally via social networks and influencers.", "This is a major shift for many Western luxury brands who still primarily target male customers in their fifties. For one Western luxury retailer, they needed to change practically every aspect of their go-to-market concept to make the brand relevant for young, digitally-savvy female customers in urban Chinese markets. They needed to gather insights about the target group and utilize advanced social-sentiment measurements with advanced data querying methods and A.I. support in order to better understand these fast-evolving preferences.", "Trend #2: KOLs replace institutions", "Only five years ago, it was the job of institutions like Vogue, Cond\u00e9 Nast Travel, or Architectural Digest to tell consumers what the latest trends in beauty, travel, and design were. But today, few editors, magazines, or publications are defining styles for new generations.", "With the emergence of influencers and key opinion leaders (KOLs), everything has changed. Now, a variety of different KOLs are busy influencing their specifically targeted followers. As a consequence, there has never been more diversity in trends, expressions, and expectations. Keeping up with this complex and fast-changing environment is a stretch for many luxury brands, and that\u2019s why real-time measurements and monitoring of important brand influencers has become critical.", "Trend #3: Digital everything", "All industries are being disrupted by technology and digitization today, and with technology continuing to speed up, a product that\u2019s been deemed great can become obsolete only a few months later. This has had a major impact on the entire luxury market.", "If a luxury hotel decides to install state-of-the-art entertainment systems in their rooms, they may be outdated by the time the installation is complete. A luxury car\u2019s multimedia system is likely to be less advanced than its owner\u2019s phone. Therefore, brands will need to come up with new solutions that allow users to stay up to date with technology, as customers are expecting the best possible results from high-end brands.", "Trend #4: Uncertainty and search for meaning", "When customers are online and connected all the time, they are often referred to as \u201csuper-empowered.\u201d They search online, they compare, they access tutorials, and they often know more about a store\u2019s products than the staff. And the younger they are, the more they expect.", "While this might suggest they feel \u201cin control,\u201d the reality is often different. Because of information overload and ever-shifting realities, super-empowered customers often feel lost and uncertain, and as such, they look to brands for meaning. It\u2019s not by chance that research indicates an increased expectation toward sustainability and ethics from Asian luxury customers.", "For this reason, successful brands must be authentic, transparent, strongly positioned, and able to guide customers. These luxury brands of the future will not only sell great products, but they\u2019ll allow customers to find their way in an uncertain world.", "Trend #5: Time matters", "In a new digital world, no one waits anymore. When websites take too long to load, customers leave and never come back. The threshold is surprisingly low and most brands don\u2019t hit the requirements in China, especially when it comes to mobile sites.

There\u2019s too much internal focus on the product and not enough emphasis on building brand equity and creating value for customers \u2014 especially younger customers.", "Many of these brands were successful with Baby Boomers and Gen Xers (in other words, consumers who are now over 40). For those generations, being associated with a \u201cbig\u201d luxury brand was important because they were trusted and they symbolized aspirations, which is why, in the early days, most traditional brands focused on creating brand awareness through storefronts, billboards, and magazine advertisements. This traditional marketing was about awareness but not necessarily about content. Product execution mattered most: materials like gold for fine watches, diamonds in jewelry, or fine leathers in cars were the content, which is why brands tended to focus on product features as a way to differentiate themselves from their competitors.", "But this strategy no longer works. Millennials, and especially Gen Zers, have different expectations and different value systems. For Baby Boomers, the sight of an expensive handbag was a rarity. There was only a handful of luxury brands to choose from, and information about these brands was relatively scarce. You had to take the time to go to the store to learn about assorted products and features. There were relatively few magazines back then that featured luxury brands, and the rare coverage only focused on a limited number of brands. In other words, 30 to 40 years ago, when many of the more established brands were growing, the market was relatively narrow, contained fewer players, and offered much less transparency to consumers.", "Brands who can\u2019t transition from a mature audience to a 20-35-year-old one will become obsolete.", "Gen Zers have grown up in a completely different reality. They are surrounded by hundreds of brands, all of which are infinitely accessible. Instead of relying on a few magazines with limited information, they know details about every brand product via social media, influencers, and key opinion leaders. In a recent discussion in Asia, the general manager of a flagship store of one of the most iconic luxury brands in the world told me that almost 100 percent of young consumers entering his store already know what they wanted. He even added that younger consumers often know the products better (and in more detail) than his in-store staff. This generation does their due diligence. The store is now solely a place to confirm purchases and be immersed in the brand\u2019s story.", "This has important implications. The number of luxury brands has grown disproportionately, and the number of new products is growing at an even faster pace. And since consumers have more transparency than ever, the room to make a real difference against your competitors with standout craftsmanship has shrunk. In many categories today, even everyday products can achieve features, looks, or performances that are very close to what luxury versions provide. In other words, luxury brands need to differentiate more than just with their products. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Quality products are still essential, but they are no longer the main factor in setting successful brands apart.", "Other factors have now become more critical, like brand purpose, social currency, context, and authenticity. Branding drives all of these. This is why refocusing on building brand equity and brand storytelling is now non-negotiable for companies that want to survive a market that\u2019s shifting toward younger consumers.", "Most luxury brands have vague positioning. They focus too much on telling the story of their entire category, so that a typical positioning statement reads like, \u201cWe at brand X pride ourselves in making the most luxurious Y (i.e. handbags, cars, jewelry, makeup) for over Z years\u201d and \u201cour passionate experts craft all our items and use the best materials available on earth.\u201d Does this sound familiar? The problem with these brand positioning statements is that they entirely disregard the customer. It is internal praise that has zero relevance with a young, digitally-native customer. That kind of brand story doesn\u2019t provide any reason to buy the brand because it doesn\u2019t tell people what\u2019s in for them (as opposed to their competitor\u2019s product).", "And yet, aside from proper positioning, brands must also master something else: an emotional connection to the consumer.

It simply can\u2019t be faked, which is why a brand must know how consumers view it. Social context is essential because young consumers need to know why they should buy the brand. There has to be a connection to the zeitgeist as well as a \u201ccool factor.\u201d Brands that fail to create social currency can\u2019t be relevant. This is why top designers, actors, fashion icons, and singers like Virgil Abloh, Pharrell Williams, Rhianna, or Zhou Dongyu have been so sought after by luxury brands or have chosen to create brands of their own. They\u2019re all about emotional connections, but not every connection works.", "There must be a logical connection between the brand story and the influencer. When Rhianna worked for Nivea, for instance, it was an odd fit, and the collaboration was seen as a colossal failure. But building her own Fenty Beauty line made more sense to consumers, and Rhianna has been successful with it. Finally, brands need to transmit a purpose to consumers, which is why brand positioning and brand storytelling is so critical. The storytelling needs to be done from the perspective of the customer where they are at the center of the story. Otherwise, there is no connection, differentiation, or value creation.", "And while the brand story is crucial, that story is highly dependent on how well the store staff brings a brand\u2019s story to life.

In China, Apple only has a market share of 8.6 percent, ranking fifth behind Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaoimi \u2014 brands most Westerners have never heard of. Other categories aren\u2019t dropping as radically, but the share of foreign cars has dropped by 13 percent during that span, and the share of watches by 6 percent. It\u2019s a trend that should concern all Western companies.", "The move toward more Chinese brand consumption started around three years ago, and now it\u2019s even impacting the storied luxury segment, as competitive Chinese brands are emerging in nearly all categories. Since China is the youngest of the large luxury markets (millennials and Gen Zers account for roughly 80 percent of luxury consumption, with a sweet spot age bracket of 25-35 years old), their consumers are more open to trying new brands, and for those consumers, country of origin is now less important than brand storytelling and the ability to create value for buyers.", "\u201cAs the Chinese economy shifts inward, McKinsey predicts between $22 trillion and $37 trillion of economic value\u2014or between 15% and 26% of global gross domestic product\u2014could disappear as supply chains shrink and other changes ripple through the global economy,\u201d says Wernau in her Wall Street Journal article. That should be a loud warning bell for Western luxury brands that still use traditional marketing, are weak at targeting millennials, and lack the advanced technology necessary to operate in a massive, fast-moving market like China\u2019s. The luxury market has benefitted strongly from Chinese customers, whether they buy inside of China or out, but when preferences shift, this model can collapse fast.", "What should Western brands do? First, they shouldn\u2019t underestimate China. Too many brands still simply take their Western business model and implement it in China \u2014 and the results are almost always disastrous. While brands need to have a global positioning, it has become increasingly important to adjust expressions of a brand\u2019s storytelling to the specifics of a country and a target group. A fifty-year-old male customer in Zurich will have different expectations, ways of communicating, and influences than a 23-year-old female customer in Beijing. Many brands struggle when targeting younger customers, and then their consumer base, revenue, and profits quickly erode. In these fast-moving times, one bad year can be enough to cement the fate of a brand.

Unfortunately, a lot of traditional luxury brands are weak storytellers. Brands are fantastic at proudly boasting about their capabilities, expertise, and savoir-faire, but they fail to translate those things into tangible rational and emotional benefits for their targeted customers.

Bitcoins and luxury goods are both rare commodities of increasing value, so HNWI (high net worth individuals) naturally gravitate toward them.

Fortunately, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies have the potential to fix most fraud issues while also bringing strategic advantages to luxury businesses.

Think Younger", "meta": "September 24, 2019", "paragraphs": ["The top management team of a leading luxury brand asked me recently whether or not they needed to address millennials. Since most of their current buyers are over 50 years old (and few people below 50 bought their brand), they thought it would be a waste of money to target younger people \u2014 a common misconception in the luxury industry. Millennials are consumers roughly born between 1980 and 2000 (20 to 40 years old), and \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 many luxury companies still ignore this important group. I often hear high-ranking brand managers say \u201cmillennials don\u2019t have money, so it\u2019s useless to target them.\u201d But in reality, nothing could be further from the truth.", "Looking at the numbers, a majority of luxury purchases worldwide are made by millennials, and in China, the group accounts for a staggering 80 percent of luxury purchases. In fact, only around 10 percent of luxury goods are bought by people over 40 in China. This should be a wake-up call. As Chinese luxury consumers have become the most crucial worldwide with the highest growth rate for luxury consumption, falling short in addressing millennials in this country means not only owning a weak brand today but also one likely to fail in the future.", "We live in a time of rapidly accelerating disruption, and a brand\u2019s size or heritage doesn\u2019t protect it from becoming irrelevant. Any brand can become irrelevant in the blink of an eye. One well-known fashion brand lost a whopping 70 percent of its younger consumers over only three years. They found out (the hard way) that heritage, craftsmanship, exquisite materials, and design mean nothing if the brand can\u2019t connect with young consumers.", "Changes happen so fast in today\u2019s luxury market that by the time a brand understands the severity of their failing, it\u2019s already too late for them. Bentley recently had to lay off 10 percent of its workforce after reporting a staggering $280 million loss and a revenue decline that hit nearly 20 percent. But it\u2019s not just older brands \u2014 even new stars in the field can fall fast. For example, one of last year\u2019s most exciting and fastest-growing beauty brands in China recently became irrelevant. Terry Wang, the managing director of JD Beauty at JD.com, told me that new brands that were more authentically connected to younger consumers had emerged, forcing this newly-minted beauty superstar to disappear completely from his platform. JD.com is China\u2019s largest retailer, and 80 percent of its customers are 35 or younger. With today\u2019s younger generations, last year\u2019s success doesn\u2019t matter if other brands can better connect with them. Therefore, the question shouldn\u2019t be whether to target millennials but how to target them better than the competition.", "Start young (very young)", "Another important question is at what age should a brand start targeting millennials? That leads to a crucial insight all brands must know: Young women in China (and in most other countries) will not wear what their mothers wear, they won\u2019t buy the beauty brands their moms buy, and they want different car brand from their moms. For older generations, on the other hand, it\u2019s the opposite: They emulate the tastes of their kids or other younger people. This is why, to be relevant to millennials, a brand cannot be considered one that \u201cthe moms use.\u201d And now we\u2019re seeing that targeting 25-years-old millennials isn\u2019t even young enough. That\u2019s because the next generation, Gen Z, is already starting to join the market, and they are crucial in helping to drive brand preferences for millennials in their 30s. As a rule, brands need to start much earlier and appeal to high schoolers and young college students.", "The success stories of Gucci, Supreme, Off-White, and Balenciaga are cases in point. They\u2019ve mastered connecting with consumers in their late teens, and this, in turn, makes them relevant to older target groups, including millennials. Many other brands miss the mark with today\u2019s youngest consumers, and as a result, they\u2019re not only unattractive to millennials but also begin losing their older consumer base. Luxury is always a result of social currency, and only brands that are seen as relevant by younger customers will thrive while those that don\u2019t risk becoming obsolete (which, as mentioned earlier, happens fast).", "Find the perfect story", "To appeal to Gen Zers, a brand\u2019s storytelling is crucial. Brands need to put their focus on building brand equity \u2014 in other words, forming clear rational and emotional positions about what the brand stands for. This needs to be told from a consumer perspective, not as an idea the brand has about itself.", "The youngest consumers are the most discerning. If they don\u2019t quickly get what\u2019s in for them (i.e. why the brand should matter to them or what value the brand provides them), they simply won\u2019t be interested. Sometimes managers ask me, \u201cHow can we get more authentic?\u201d They ask that because brands will only resonate if they are authentic. And since a brand\u2019s story is the driver of authenticity, regular brand audits and critical evaluations of a brand\u2019s storytelling are indispensable.", "Brand storytelling is not primarily about advertising, which is a common misconception. In its most elemental form, it\u2019s the way a brand creates value. Everything the brand does needs to follow the brand story: at each consumer touchpoint and with each product. All actions should be seen as part of the delivery system for the brand story. Brands that are weak in storytelling will never be perceived as authentic and relevant, and they won\u2019t be able to create luxury value and sustain their market position. Brand storytelling describes what the brand sells \u2014 both rationally and emotionally. It must be much more distinct than what everyone else in the category does and much more precise than simply claiming to \u201csell a dream.\u201d Cliches like this mean nothing to consumers.", "The message must be digital", "To deliver these stories, digital capabilities are critical. Most brands lack in most CRM (customer relationship management) capabilities, and even if they have a system, it\u2019s not connected and efficient enough to support personalized customer interactions. But going even deeper, most brands lack IRM (influencer relationship management) systems, which help identify and engage with necessary KOLs and influencers. Not having those capabilities is deadly, because younger consumers \u2014 particularly in China \u2014 are more receptive to people than brands. Therefore, key opinion consumers who influence their peers and followers need to be managed as precisely as any other brand element. It\u2019s important that influencers accurately reflect a brand\u2019s storytelling to help create consistency.", "And finally, many brands also lack real-time consumer insights, which are necessary for management teams\u2019 daily decision making. To glean these insights, a brand needs artificial intelligence to process the big data it\u2019s constantly receiving. Today, insights from traditional market research studies are too slow and imprecise, and thereby, in most cases, they\u2019re irrelevant.", "The good news is that rapid change can provide incredible opportunities for brands, but only if they\u2019re properly prepared. In luxury, the youngest consumers have to come first since they influence all the other generations before them. Thus, different thinking beyond one\u2019s comfort zone is imperative.

Instead, they need to tell their customers what unique value they create specifically for them by the things they do exceptionally well.", "In luxury, it\u2019s about them (customer-centricity), not us (internal capabilities). Exceptional craftsmanship only creates value if there is a perceivable distinction between other luxury brands, and if this distinction can be expressed as a value proposition towards the customer.

Especially for Millennials and Gen Zers consumers who expect this the most.", "To create a value proposition, brands need to provide a rational and an emotional benefit. Both are important and need to be a consistent part of the brand story. Few brands, however, have clarity around their emotional core, their purpose, and the way how they inspire their customers. What I often see is that they express, as their emotional positioning, the creation of dreams. The problem with this is: Unless the dream is explicitly defined, it seldom will create any customer value, and it won\u2019t differentiate the brand. More precision is needed.", "As a result, we typically find brands that are talking to themselves about themselves and in an imprecise way, and not differentiating enough from their competitors. Not surprisingly, a Chinese executive of a leading European fashion brand told me recently that, \u201cWe all do the same thing. All brands seem to do exactly what everyone else is doing.\u201d Clearly, this is not the path to create a sustainable competitive advantage and it explains why so many luxury brands struggle.

Missing the mark is just another of many possible reasons why so many Western brands can fail in this market.", "The next hidden danger luxury brands face is that of losing further precision of the story along the customer journey. There are very few brands that can tell their brand story consistently at each touchpoint. When you think about staying at a hotel, the customer journey is predictable. Few unexpected things happen.

But what exactly makes luxury such a tricky and volatile segment?", "Much of what seems intuitively right in luxury is actually dead wrong. A common misconception is that the qualities of a product define its ultimate luxury value. In other words, many brands believe that people pay for the beauty and the amenities of a hotel room, for the quality craftsmanship of a handbag, and the alluring design of a hypercar. All those elements are essential for positioning a product as a luxury item, but they aren\u2019t the drivers of luxury value.", "Those elements don\u2019t drive consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, which is an important distinction. What luxury consumers mainly pay for is added luxury value (ALV). ALV is comprised of brand-related social status effects which include the perception of enhanced attractiveness, social protection, being perceived as an expert, or for the experience of something new. When we measure added luxury value, the product is not part of it. This is what confounds managers of highly engineered luxury brands (like cars) or design-driven luxury brands (like handbags or hotels).

The result was a stunning architectural masterpiece, with a beautiful new lobby, a fantastic restaurant, and beautiful rooms that wow everyone who sees them. The spa is second to none, and the amenities are outstanding. But after the renovation was complete, something unexpected happened. Bookings and room occupancy went down. Panicked, the hotel commissioned a guest survey, and to their surprise, customer satisfaction was at an all-time-low; people were never as disappointed as after experiencing the renovated hotel. In other words, a multi-million-dollar improvement led to a decrease in perceived value! Revenue decreased, customers were less happy, profits plummeted, and millions were wasted. It\u2019s an example I see all the time across all luxury categories.", "When looking into the reasons for the hotel\u2019s dramatic downfall, it became clear that the company underestimated their luxury value, which wasn\u2019t the quality of the property but was mainly the standout and personalized service. The human factor was more important in terms of value proposition than the physical \u201cproduct\u201d of the hotel. When the property was upgraded, the hotel didn\u2019t re-train the staff or explain to them what the added luxury meant. The hotel was seen as luxurious before, but the upgrade raised the bar for the company by triggering higher customer expectations toward the service. Therefore, the customers were disappointed with the service \u2014 which had already been great \u2014 but no longer seemed on par with what the new positioning suggested.

When a customer calls him at 11 p.m. and tells him her hair looks horrible and she needs immediate intervention, he will gather his staff regardless of the day of the week or the time of day. They open the salon even after midnight, if needed, or fly clients in by helicopter and will take care of their concerns at a moment\u2019s notice. This is made possible by reducing the number of clients and offering them personalized services. While the salon is, of course, beautiful, that\u2019s not the factor that leads people to pay such high prices for haircuts.

In other words, the most personalized services that no one else anywhere provides, which goes far beyond the building and the haircut.", "What must luxury brands need do then? Whether you are offering a luxury product or a luxury service, the most critical task is to define what sets your brand apart. Attributes like heritage, craftsmanship, expertise, experience, or \u201ccreating a dream\u201d are what many companies thinksets them apart, but they are irrelevant. That\u2019s because, in luxury, consumers expect everyoneto offer them the ultimate craftsmanship, expertise, or experience. They buy a \u201cdream\u201d with every luxury purchase, so when they go to a luxury hotel, they expect a spectacular room, and when they buy a hypercar, they expect exhilarating acceleration and stunning design.

Consumers expect memorable moments, an escape from their daily routines, and most importantly, want to fall in love with a brand.

Many luxury brands struggle to create a target group relevancy that would allow them to be seen as must-have brands. A different approach is needed. Instead of changing the marketing first, companies should start by building brand equity before anything else.

One cardinal mistake is when a brand tells their story from an internal perspective, such as \u201cwe are masters of handmade craftsmanship.\u201d Apart from being too vague, a story like this isn\u2019t relevant unless it translates into a tangible consumer benefit.", "Why the customer journey is crucial", "Another typical mistake brands make is not creating a branded experience across all customer touchpoints. Many brands create what I call a \u201ccategory journey,\u201d which means they do exactly what everyone else in their category is doing, so they become impossible to differentiate from other brands. On top of that, one imperfect touchpoint is more than enough to destroy the delicate perception of luxury. Very few brands have customer journey managers, and even fewer have created dedicated brand-equity building strategies for each touchpoint. Focusing on the \u201cimportant\u201d touchpoints is not enough: They\u2019re allimportant.

The company\u2019s former CEO asked the store staff in China what they would do to grow the brand, and they said to redesign the stores to have more foot traffic. After following this advice, more people did enter the store, but surprisingly, sales plummeted, and the average price of their top-end products permanently decreased by roughly $100 per unit, which led to a catastrophic profitability loss the brand never recovered from. Why? Because the increased store traffic was made up of consumers who were spending less. Then, the company responded by offering \u201caffordable luxury\u201d items. Not only that, but the former high-end customers stopped coming to the stores because there were too many people there and they didn\u2019t feel it was luxurious enough anymore. The brand became too expensive for the remaining customers, so instead of growing the brand through added \u201caffordable\u201d luxury, the brand decreased in revenue and profit, even after reaching a larger audience.", "\u00a0Pricing mistakes: Why many luxury brands are too cheap", "When companies in luxury use their competition as a benchmark for pricing, they will always price incorrectly. This is because the price of luxury has to reflect the so-called Added Luxury Value (ALV) that the luxury brand creates. This value can be estimated, but it depends on the brand, not on a product\u2019s features. In fact, some of today\u2019s most expensive luxury cars, which are already priced between $2-10 million, are priced too cheap, with their profit potential yet to be realized. The same goes for the luxury segment of almost any category, including handbags, fashion, accessories, and more.

That\u2019s because doing social media listening alone is useless. Brands must deploy A.I.-supported technologies that allow them to make sense of their data. In short, most companies today operate in China without sufficient or timely understanding of consumers.

In China, the brand always comes first when people buy luxury. Just showing a spectacular handbag or a car without telling the brand\u2019s story does not work. Unfortunately, most of the communication content that brands create in China is irrelevant to consumers there, with brands wasting millions of dollars without any ROI. Additionally, the need to create digitally connected brand communities is often neglected because it\u2019s currently less important in the West.

This is the wrong idea, and I\u2019ll explain why. Many people think \u201cluxury\u201d is the equivalent of \u201can expensive price point,\u201d and many brands price that way. They use the price as a marker of luxury, which may work in the short-term but won\u2019t in the long term. That\u2019s because a high price point is a result of luxury; it isn\u2019t the driver. This is an important distinction. To sell luxury means to create extreme value. Once that value is created, a brand can price for it, but if the brand prices high without creating underlying value, it will not succeed over time.", "Normal to premium brands have two value drivers: functions and basic emotions. Both create the value that people pay prices for. If you think about Starbucks, a cup of coffee may cost between $3 and $5. You pay a bit more for the larger size and less for the smaller size. Hence, the price is \u2014 to some degree \u2014 the result of a logical, linear pricing structure. The more you get, the more you pay. On top of that, a more premium brand will charge a few percentage points more than a less premium brand. Everything makes logical sense. There are no surprises. This is the world of normal to premium brands.", "Luxury is different. Suddenly we are in a world where prices are detached from features or emotions. Think about a Lamborghini: It has a small cabin, isn\u2019t overly comfortable, only seats two, doesn\u2019t have a trunk, and is very loud inside. While it may be fast, a 7-seating Tesla Model X will outperform it in a sprint. In terms of functional features, the car should be priced at the lower end, However, at price points of $300,000 and up, the brand has a non-linear value jump, especially compared to the value-heavy Mercedes S Class or a BMW 5 Series. This is why: When we measure the value of a luxury brand, we find an added value component that normal or premium products don\u2019t have that I call Added Luxury Value (ALV).", "Added Luxury Value is comprised of some more obvious dimensions: social dominance, being an ultimate treat, adding self-esteem, and more, but it also has hidden dimensions like adding attractiveness, giving the aura of expertise, and signaling high-quality decision-making. Extensive research studies show that these are the real drivers of luxuriousness, and that produced ALV is also typically a multiplier of other value components. In other words: Added Luxury Value, is worth dramatically more than the functional or basic emotional value of a brand when it comes to luxury product, and this value is, ironically, created by the brand (branding) and not by the product itself.", "This is a remarkable insight. If you take a Lamborghini, the value of the car \u2014 excluding ALV \u2014 would be maybe around $50-100,000. But with ALV, it sells for $300,000 or above. Take a handbag: Without ALV, people may pay $50-100. Adding ALV makes a brand like Louis Vuitton sell for $2,000 and above, while Herm\u00e8s achieves price points of $10,000 or higher. Most of that value is due to ALV.", "If ALV is detached from the product (for instance, the design or the features), but connected to the brand and its story, then comparing one product to the other across brands makes no sense. However, most managers do exactly that. When they create prices, they look at what the competition is doing with the product and ignore the ALV they create.

What if, in the case of the Lamborghini, every company in a category is using gut feeling (in other words, benchmarking prices without factoring in ALV)?

This is called a \u2018category bias,\u2019 and many brands fall in its trap.", "As an example, despite what experts and the media thought, all of the most expensive cars were too cheap ten years ago.

But today, Bugatti just sold their first new car for over $10 million, and new cars with price points between $2 and $5 million have become more \u201cnormal.\u201d They may still even be too cheap! Back then, the problem was that every competitor was too low at its highest price tier. Because every company observed each other and priced their products in line with the others, all the top luxury brands were too cheap. The difference in results after a price hike is dramatic. If a car company that sells 10,000 units per year could have sold their cars for an average of 100,000 U.S. dollars more than they did, the profit impact is $1 billion per year.

Many managers tell me that this is what they do already. When I ask how much time, resources, and budget are invested in the brand versus the products, almost all admit that most internal time and money is allocated towards product development. In luxury, this is not enough. Brand needs to be defined along all touch-points, with no detail of the consumer journey left unplanned. The brand is the origin of value creation. Luxury brands can only survive if they deliver extreme value consistently and flawlessly.", "D&G was a warning for all other luxury brands. Nothing had happened since then.

According to Cheq report, a micro-influencer with 10,000 followers can garner up to $250 for a sponsored post, while big names with over 1 million followers can make as much as $250,000 per post.", "According to WalktheChat and Jing Daily, influencers manage large staffs in China, which facilitates recurrent collaborations with brands. Jing Daily\u00a0also points out that the Chinese influencer Gogoboi charges as much as $50,000 per post and runs up to 15 different brand partnerships every month. China has many major, legitimate influencers like Gogoboi, but there are also social media users and nano-influencers with followings that are too small or too niche for luxury brands\u2019 purposes. Desperate for partnerships with luxury conglomerates, some of these individuals misrepresent the size of their followings, thereby exaggerating the power of their bases. By partnering with these influencers, brands can damage their reputations, raise their marketing costs, and even lose potential revenue. On the other hand, the influencers, meanwhile, will temporarily boost their ad revenue, but they have little chance of building a long-term, successful business this way.", "How can luxury companies operating in China combat fake followers?", "Suppressing the fake follower phenomenon and combating digital cheats is getting increasingly difficult, and the practice requires a good working relationship between the Chinese government, social media companies, and private businesses. Luckily, the Chinese government and Weibo launched initiatives to crack down on the problem, although there\u2019s still more work to be done.", "First, social media platforms should aim for total transparency. They need to strive for integrity, ethics, and sincerity, and this implies offering brands legitimate data on user followings and engagement numbers. In the West, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter frequently liquidate suspicious accounts and block users who engage in shady activities. Beyond that, Instagram has implemented the \u201clike\u201d ban, which is now expanding to new regions of the world. According to Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, the Facebook-owned social media platform wants \u201cpeople to worry a little bit less about how many likes they\u2019re getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about.\u201d", "Following a decade of scandals and tragedies (melamine-tainted milk, contaminated strawberries, and fake eggs), Chinese consumers have grown to distrust traditional advertising, so brands find it increasingly difficult to build trust and long-standing relationships with these consumers. But by featuring the name of an influencer or a peer-to-peer marketing campaign in China, international brands believed they had worked out an effective strategy for reaching those potential buyers. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated than it seems.", "For instance, China\u2019s short video app Douyin is now \u201con fire,\u201d reaching over 100 million users in only its first year. Additionally, 60 percent of its users are female and 70 percent are living in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. This is more or less the dream demographic for luxury brands. But the problem with the app is that many of the Douyin\u2019s influencers engage in fraudulent practices by growing their base through bot accounts.", "Jing Daily\u2019s\u00a0Ruonan Zheng says that \u201cfake followers are a fundamental part of Chinese social media platforms.\u201d Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth mentioning that such fraudulent customs will ultimately undermine consumer confidence. Furthermore, a documentary by China\u2019s state owned-CCTV showed that the problem goes beyond scamming brands into risky partnerships with inflated user volumes. CCTV raises serious concerns about the exploitation of workers, as the trend is fueled by employees who get less than the minimum wage for spending hours liking and commenting on social media posts.", "A good policy would be for domestic and international brands operating in China to follow Unilever\u2019s example and only partner with influencers who don\u2019t buy followers or work with \u201cclick farms.\u201d Keith Weed, the former Unilever Chief Marketing Officer, said that Unilever will seek partnerships with influencers who strive to \u201cincrease transparency and help eradicate bad practices throughout the whole ecosystem.\u201d And Daniel Avital, Chief Strategy Officer at CHEQ, a company that specializes in, among other things, cutting-edge AI and cybersecurity, believes brands should perform their own audit procedures by vetting KOLs before\u00a0partnering with them.", "The easiest way to analyze an influencer\u2019s engagement is by checking their long-term performance. Brands should consider influencers with a natural growth curve, while \u201cshooting stars\u201d and KOLs who record sudden spikes in engagement should be disregarded.", "What\u2019s next?", "Instead of fighting against social media bots, some luxury houses will bring that technology into their marketing plans. Virtual influencers and online testimonials already exist, and this trend will likely transform the marketing landscape for the benefit of the companies that use them. Rather than dealing with KOLs embroiled in PR scandals and bad behavior, brands will get smoothly functioning digital influencers who act properly, look impeccable, and engage peacefully with their audience.", "Shudu Gram is \u201cthe world\u2019s first digital supermodel,\u201d and she has a fan base of 179K followers on Instagram and partnerships with brands like Ellesse and Balmain.

I spotted several Dior and Herm\u00e8s handbags and several gold watches by Audemars Piguet and Patek Phillippe.

How do they know what within their favored brand was a \u201chot\u201d item? Conversely, how can companies understand what is trending in China versus what is fading? How can they identify sentiment? And how can they see the early warning signs that consumers are losing interest in a particular item?", "Traditionally, Western companies have relied heavily on market research surveys. An iconic luxury brand recently told me about their experiences with these studies in China. In short, they called them a disaster. They tried surveying customers in China using conventional market research methods, but they generated almost no actionable insights, and they weren\u2019t sure if the results were even relevant, because they couldn\u2019t cover enough cities in China. They received results, but they didn\u2019t know if those results were representative at all. It was a slow process that didn\u2019t allow for changes in the sentiment or trends. Frankly, most brands tend to struggle with this same challenge in China.", "It is why most Western companies underperform in China. Even if they have initial growth, few can stay profitable over time, and the luxury companies leaving China because they couldn\u2019t hit their targets even include quality businesses like the French retailer Carrefour and the Japanese retailer Takashima. It was reported that Takashima lost money in China in the three years before its departure \u2014 a closure that was estimated to have cost them approximately $30 million. In an article on June 28, 2019, the South China Morning Post cited a spokesperson of Takashima who said, \u201cRapid changes in the consumption structure and fierce industry competition have exceeded our expectations.\u201d Like others, they were too slow to generate insights into the rapidly changing consumer sentiment/habits/trends in the Chinese market. By the time they understood what was happening, it was too late.", "I am confronted with stories like these almost daily. Companies do not invest in an appropriate operating model for China. Many believe they can launch in China with approaches similar to the ones they use in other regions and fail as a result. The ultra-dynamic, vast, and fast-changing Chinese market requires a sophisticated, data-driven management approach. While many companies talk about digitization, very few are applying it sufficiently today. Most have a standard CRM and use basic social media listening tools, however, very few companies build an infrastructure that offers them actionable insights created from available data. This is where AI is a game-changer.", "It is important to note here that A.I. is an often-overused term. It\u2019s only one part of advanced data querying technologies used to help organize big data, identify relationships and trends, and help companies take the guesswork out of decisions. Hence, companies need to combine AI with machine learning and other appropriate tools for different situations. Most importantly, the company\u2019s entire data infrastructure needs to be structured in a way that connects all data sources so relationships between them can be identified and understood.", "But why exactly is AI so important, and how can luxury brands apply it in China? Imagine this typical challenge many luxury companies face: A luxury brand in China has an aging consumer profile and isn\u2019t appealing to Millennials and Gen Zers. Its flagship stores in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong don\u2019t have enough foot traffic and can\u2019t generate enough revenue to cover their costs. Brand loyalty is decreasing, and market shares are eroding. What needs to be done?", "This is where many companies simply rely on gut feeling. They may switch their advertising agency, run promotions that just erode brand equity, or try out new campaigns or influencers. They may even develop a WeChat Mini Program. But, if they lack fundamental insights on what\u2019s wrong with the branding, there is a high probability that all those measures will change nothing or even compound their problems.", "Instead, a company should use machine learning and a sophisticated AI engine to analyze all available data points, including the millions of conversations consumers have about the brand online, which can be challenging because of the firewalled Chinese internet. Afterward, the brand should understand the precise consumer sentiment about itself, and, more importantly, the changes in that sentiment over time. This analysis goes beyond simple social media listening because it gathers data across several brand touchpoints (from store foot traffic to online sales) to create a model of how changes in sentiment impact purchase patterns. Only then can a brand identify the real reasons for its negative performance, which could be anything from weak brand positioning to inefficient communication campaigns. Only then can a company develop precise strategies to strengthen its brand and its performance while also identifying significant marketing savings and efficiency gains.", "China is one of the most attractive markets for luxury brands today, but it is also one of the most challenging. The sophistication and expectations of luxury consumers in the country are among the highest in the world, and their youngest consumers expect the most while also driving the most market change.

This caught some Kering fans, who are familiar with Gucci\u2019s success in China, off-guard. It was just in 2016 that Bomoda and R3 Worldwide rated Gucci as the country\u2019s top brand in Study of Social Media Influencers. Moreover, Gucci was one of the few Western brands to use mainland marketing models even in their international campaigns \u2014 a fact that was widely celebrated in China. Aside from that, many in the industry truly believed that only Gucci\u2019s creative director Alessandro Michele could fully understand China\u2019s younger consumers, but apparently, that is not the case.", "Now, Louis Vuitton is registering \u201cunheard-of growth rates\u201d in China, and this begs the question: How did they do it? Below, Jing Daily breaks down the five major reasons behind Louis Vuitton\u2019s runaway success and where they can improve in the future:", "1. A strong focus on younger consumers", "In the past few years, Louis Vuitton began reaching out to millennials and Gen Zers, which turned out to be a brilliant money-making idea. In the not-too-distant past, heritage brands only wanted to be associated with excess wealth and privilege. But today\u2019s luxury is more inclusive and less hostile. By collaborating with streetwear brands (Supreme), partnering with young influencers (Selena Gomez, Karlie Kloss, and Emma Chamberlain), and building an online presence that connects with younger consumers, Louis Vuitton has created a global uproar while rewriting the rules of audience engagement in this booming marketplace.", "Their digital performance is especially striking. With 7.38 million Twitter followers and 33 million Instagram followers, Louis Vuitton is leading the social media revolution globally and is proving that a heritage brand can be savvy with social media. While some heritage brands (Chanel) have remained highly inaccessible, Louis Vuitton continues to break new ground with social media engagement \u2014 an attitude that\u2019s atypical for luxury brands, who are often slow to engage with consumers online. Specific to China, Louis Vuitton attracted younger customers by highlighting streetwear collaborations and leveraging the power of KOLs in that country. Choosing rapper and television celebrity Kris Wu as their brand ambassador was an audacious move that sent both fans and haters into a frenzy while allowing social media conversations about the brand to thrive.", "2. Embracing digital innovation", "For all the talk about embracing digital innovation, most luxury brands have taken a slower approach to that change, and several luxury houses still haven\u2019t integrated consistent digital brand experiences. Yet, according to Digimind, a global social media intelligence company, 93 percent of consumer engagement with luxury brands takes place on Instagram, and 40 percent of luxury purchases are influenced \u2014 to a certain degree \u2014 by online content. So why haven\u2019t brands moved faster to digital? It seems as if many still don\u2019t know how to create a personalized digital experience or maintain a digital storefront that can generate traffic or sales. In contrast, Louis Vuitton is a digital pioneer, having just recently created a WeChat Mini Program specifically for the launch of their Virgil Abloh-designed sneakers.", "3. Stricter control of distribution channels", "Louis Vuitton has remained cautious with their distribution rights, and this vigilance has benefited the brand in the long run. Eventually, if a luxury house expands excessively (as Gucci has, for instance), it hurts the brand\u2019s overall status and value. Ralph Lauren is the perfect example of this. Due to international licensing agreements and aggressive sales policies, the brand lost much of its original identity and \u2018snooty\u201d appeal in China. Despite the fact that brands can now reach more potential consumers than ever, the allure of luxury is all about its exclusivity, and no one wants to invest in a widely available premium item. Louis Vuitton fans know that the brand doesn\u2019t have sales or a wholesale policy for department stores. Because of this, Louis Vuitton keeps their production and pricing in check, therefore, always maintaining their high-end appeal.", "4. Streamlining China operations", "According to the South China Morning Post, Louis Vuitton streamlined China operations \u201cto create a better consumer experience and improve margins.\u201d Michael Burke, Chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, says that Louis Vuitton closed eight stores in China but refurbished their existing ones. Moreover, all stores were supplied with full merchandise lines, including the highly coveted pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter collections.", "5. Staying in front of product trends", "According to a statement from Louis Vuitton, their Fashion and Leather Goods department \u201cdelivered an exceptional performance\u201d in 2018. A lot of that is because, through artistic collaborations (like the one with contemporary artist Jeff Koons in 2017, for instance), Louis Vuitton has resurrected iconic leather accessories, with younger consumers now enthusiastically embracing those products.", "Additionally, Louis Vuitton decided to take the customization trend a step further by starting their \u201cNow Yours Run Away\u201d personalization program for sneakers in October 2018. Since authenticity and self-expression are important to China\u2019s younger consumers, they like influencing the design process of the products they buy. This is why the customization trend responds well to their needs. In this case, Louis Vuitton found a balanced blueprint for success by adapting a long-selling product with strict considerations for quality and design to resonate with younger consumers.", "What then is next for Louis Vuitton in China? They supposedly will continue to invest in cross-channel customer experiences. But if the French luxury house is serious about keeping its pole position, it must stay relevant. WeChat and Douyin have become great marketing platforms in China, but Louis Vuitton needs to find new, innovative ways to reach their consumer base. Furthermore, one issue that remains is finding a balance between the brand\u2019s heritage and these types of innovation.", "Louis Vuitton is a digitally-minded forerunner in the field, but mature consumers might distance themselves from the brand because of overexposure. While the French luxury house is doing a great job at building awareness and talking to Gen Zers and millennials, they seem to be overlooking the potential of the mature consumers who have been their staunch supporters in the past. This is a heritage brand that moved from ads starring 20th-century titans like Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Francis Ford Coppola to instead featuring video game characters and teenagers in their campaigns. The future of Louis Vuitton depends on keeping younger generations of consumers around without neglecting their loyal, mature luxury buyers. Speaking to different niche groups one-on-one is the solution.", "In short, Louis Vuitton needs to discover new growth opportunities without damaging the reputation of the brand. Managing brand exposure in the new global economy is a real balancing act, but no brand is better positioned to walk this tightrope than the luxury market\u2019s reigning champ."]}, {"title": "Managing Fakes is Good Business in China", "meta": "July 23, 2019", "paragraphs": ["When Chinese consumers buy luxury goods online, a primary concern is receiving a fake product. This is driven, in part, by the long history of counterfeits available on the Chinese market. Because of this, some Chinese consumers prefer to buy luxury products in brand stores when they travel to Paris or Milan. However, with the recent increase in online sales of luxury products in China, brands and online retailers must take action to guarantee the authenticity of their products.", "For the customer, it\u2019s difficult to know if a product is authentic. Even if they buy from authorized retailers, there\u2019s always a risk. For example, a fake product could enter into an otherwise legitimate supply chain. Perhaps it got there as part of a return process where the fake went unnoticed. Or maybe there was no end-to-end authentication process in the supply chain, and the imitation entered somewhere en route to its owner. As a result, customers who want real products don\u2019t know for sure if what they\u2019re buying is authentic.", "The problem compounds in the pre-owned luxury marketplace, which is growing exponentially and has become very popular with millennials. As an example, someone may want to use a specific sneaker for a social media post and then sell it again. It is paramount to make sure that the products sold are authentic. However, most retailers have not yet deployed technologies that allow customers to verify that a product is real before purchasing.", "Irene Woerner, CEO of the authentication company emTRUTH, explained to me during a recent discussion why luxury brands and luxury retailers are increasingly using some form of technology that lets them ensure that their products are 100 percent real. \u201cWe ensure traceability during the entire life of a product, down to what it\u2019s made of,\u201d Woerner said. \u201cEverything is encrypted in transit and at rest.\u201d To do this, emTRUTH creates a digital twin of the product with blockchain technology. The twin contains all relevant information about the product and allows the seller to trace its history and confirm its authenticity. The deployment of such an end-to-end traceability solution helps manage the risk of buying online.", "With best practices, such technologies allow customers to look up a specific product in a database even before they buy it. Ideally, the database will include a breakdown of the materials used, their origins, and a detailed sustainability footprint, the latter of which more and more Gen Zers have become interested in. Until recently, it was difficult for companies to offer full transparency when it came to authenticity and sustainability for a product along all touchpoints and for all materials, and often the breakdown happened when suppliers would use sub-suppliers. But with a blockchain twin, the whole history of a supply chain can be accurately mapped and made transparent. Additionally, customers can trace the history of a finished luxury product and validate that the product is authentic before they even own it.", "By offering a product\u2019s sustainability and authenticity, luxury sellers help enable both their e-commerce and brick-and-mortar sales. They put customers at ease who might otherwise have doubts that could lead to them not purchasing a luxury item. And as more and more Gen Zers enter into the luxury marketplace, these technologies can lead to a significant competitive advantage for luxury brands or suppliers.", "Apart from offering more customer-centricity, luxury brands receive an additional benefit from authentication technology: Now, their products can all come with a black box upon being sold. While brands used to know little or nothing about how an individual customer used the product, how long they used it, and if or when they resold it, now companies can generate powerful insights by creating a blockchain twin that also maps the purchase and repurchase histories of a product. This allows brands to better target consumers and offer them more relevant product recommendations. It also provides vital knowledge of when a customer may be ready to buy a new product.", "In the best case, companies can extend the management of a customer\u2019s journey far beyond the initial purchase and through the entire life of the product. When combined with all other data sources and AI-based data querying technologies, authentication can lead to better customer service and management. Plus, it offers customers added transparency as well as the guarantee of authenticity that they\u2019re increasingly demanding. This offers the customer significantly more value, which will undoubtedly give brands an essential advantage in the future.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle, and consumer brand strategy firm\u00a0\u00c9quit\u00e9.

With its strong appeal to the world\u2019s youngest luxury consumers, Gucci is on track to become the largest luxury fashion brand in the world if its growth trajectory continues at its current pace.", "One of the key enablers of their success has been investments in technology, as seen in their ArtLab: a futuristic factory where artistic experimentation is blended with 21st-century production processes. As a result, the brand can transform ideas and concepts into products at a higher speed than many of their competitors, meeting the Gen-Z demand for quick and unique product drops while enabling creatives to implement their ideas much faster than ever before.", "Bizzarri also smartly enlisted a \u201cshadow committee\u201d comprised of Gen-Z and Millennial members from around the world to meet with technology experts and discover new ideas and approaches. \u201cThese [young] people often know much more about certain things than you do,\u201d says Bizzarri on the importance of involving younger consumers in the development process. But what exactly can other brands learn from Gucci\u2019s uncommon methods?", "Accelerated market speeds", "We are living in one of the most exciting times for innovative luxury brands. Technological change and market disruption are both happening at a faster rate than ever before, and because information travels faster, consumers are better informed than ever. Therefore, the youngest consumers come equipped with the highest expectation\u2019s brands have ever seen \u2014 a dramatic paradigm shift from just a decade ago.", "Given this, permanent adaptation and reinvention are absolutely necessary now because consumers are less patient now. Thereby, technology becomes an enabler that optimizes processes, responds faster, and ultimately provides better and faster service. When consumers look for instant gratification, brands need to build preconditions so they can deliver against those expectations.", "Brand equity and brand storytelling", "Building up a strong brand story was one of the cornerstones of Gucci\u2019s success, and with Bizzarri\u2019s arrival, Gucci refocused sharply on creating brand equity. A brand\u2019s storytelling is one of the critical drivers of extreme value creation \u2014 a concept the best and most relevant luxury brands have mastered. In the years between Tom Ford\u2019s departure and Bizzarri\u2019s arrival, Gucci\u2019s positioning in the market became too vague and undifferentiated. This has changed. Now there\u2019s a very distinct and consistent brand attitude expressed through artistic mastery, advertising, and in-store experiences. This helps create a cohesive brand message for customers all over the world, but especially among Chinese customers, who are much more brand-obsessed than customers from other regions. And the brand personality Gucci has created feels relevant to them.", "Many brands focus too much on the product and underestimate the importance of rigorous and excellent brand definition and execution. This can make brands vulnerable and tends to lead to \u2018one-hit-wonders\u2019 instead of consistent success. Brands must combine great storytelling with excellent product execution to win over Millennials and Gen Zers these days. Given the quickly-evolving and highly-competitive landscape, a brand should undergo an audit to clarify its positioning at least every two years, if not more often. This is not to change a brand\u2019s strategy permanently, but rather to ensure that the strategy is both differentiated and relevant enough in a market with ever-changing trends and competitors.", "Listening to customers", "In markets like China where consumers spend their daily lives on WeChat (doing a significant part of their brand interactions via digital channels) opinions change regularly. Therefore, listening to consumers is an indispensable part of brand research. Traditional market research methods aren\u2019t working anymore because they\u2019re too slow, imprecise, or don\u2019t offer actionable insights in real-time. The infamous Dolce & Gabbana case in China demonstrated that perceptions can change within hours, and brands must be able to identify those changes as they happen. Social media listening is not sufficient for locating fast-paced shifts in consumer sentiment. Today\u2019s best practices involve advanced data querying technologies (including AI and machine learning) that offer rapid pattern recognition and the generation of timely and relevant counteractions.", "By making the target group part of the decision-making body, a brand ensures that the direction they take will resonate with those consumers. Too many brands still use \u201cguessing and hoping\u201d and then wonder why their marketing campaigns and product launches don\u2019t achieve their objectives. Listening to young customers by implementing up-to-date technical infrastructures and integrating them into decision-making processes takes guessing out of the equation and lets a brand know for sure that their content will be relevant.", "Gucci\u2019s success in today\u2019s market is unparalleled and stands as an example of how the correct combination of leadership, creativity, brand equity-focus, customer-centricity, and enabling technology can propel a brand to significant growth. Bizzarri and his team have done a good job at positioning their brand in a way that feels relevant to Millennials and Gen Zers, and since those demographics will only get more important with age, Gucci should have no problem prospering in the future.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle, and consumer brand strategy firm\u00a0\u00c9quit\u00e9.

If you think about luxury skincare cream or makeup, applying the product on your skin is essential for many consumers before they purchase the item, and consumers might want to test drive a car or try on a piece of jewelry for similar reasons. Aside from personally experiencing the product, the luxury store staff can also provide a customer with recommendations, suggest alternatives, or inspire them to consider products they never would have chosen otherwise.", "However, the examples of online purchases that exceed $100,000 in value last year show that consumers are increasingly open to buying luxury online. And having the world\u2019s most digital consumers, China is leading this trend.

With more than 80 percent of luxury purchases in China coming from consumers younger than 40 years of age, a large shift in where luxury consumers make purchases is clearly happening.", "It is important to note, though, that digital is not replacing brick-and-mortar purchases. We estimate that only about one percent of all consumers in China buy luxury exclusively online. Around 40 percent of all Chinese luxury consumers mix online with offline buying, and this includes Gen Xers. Vogue Business cites Cartier, stating that their online sales were incremental to the sales in stores, but their relaunch of the iconic Panth\u00e8re watch through a Net-a-Porter pop-up was so successful, the company opted for a permanent presence on that platform.", "Even if the vast majority of luxury purchases are still in stores, online plays a vital role in influencing those purchases. I asked the general manager of a successful luxury car dealership in Asia how many customers decided on their purchases in the store. His answer? Almost no one. He told me that most customers had already made up their mind using the internet before they\u2019d entered the store. They search for reviews, data, and information, and they compare thoroughly. In China, consumers, who spend most of their digital life on WeChat, follow influencers and form their opinions about the brand before they enter the store, or in this case, the luxury car dealership. However, he added, the dealership experience is an essential part of the sale. Coming to the store confirms the decision in the best case or reverses the choice in the worst case.

When a consumer wants to buy in a store, he or she should have the opportunity to do so, and when he or she wants to buy online, there needs to be a seamless option.", "Therefore, brands should map their entire customer journey digitally and collect and connect data for each touchpoint.

It\u2019s the same logic as controlling the sales environment in brick-and-mortar. Setting the highest standards needs to apply online, too. Third-party sites are possible but should only be considered if the brand story can be told correctly and with the same precision as on a proprietary website.", "Data is the connective tissue", "Kering\u2019s approach of using A.I. to identify insights from their consumer data is a step in the right direction.

Any brand should be able to 1. measure the ROI of a marketing campaign to track a specific sale when the consumer was exposed to a brand message to evaluate their effectiveness, and 2. to measure consumer consent on an ongoing basis. An automated A.I. tool should scan every online conversation for trending topics and anomalies to identify critical issues in real time. Anything less than that is not acceptable in today\u2019s world of digital natives.

Underestimating Chinese consumers", "Chinese millennial consumers are highly educated, and their familiarity with digital tools makes them highly empowered. Despite that, brands do little \u2014 or the wrong type of \u2014 market research. Traditional market research is a waste of money in China because surveys focus on too few cities, don\u2019t reach enough consumers, and their results are too slow. In the fast-changing world of Chinese millennial consumers, studies that were taken even two months ago might already be useless or misleading. Only real-time consumer measurements of AI-powered social media listening techniques can steer brands accurately in China. Chinese social media networks are firewalled and challenging to analyze, but with the right expertise and machine learning, brands can correctly observe or analyze data on their consumers, brand, competition, and more.", "2. Using the wrong communication content", "Many brands fail because they convince themselves that the content produced for the rest of the world will also be relevant in China. Aside from the content itself, brands must know the delivery systems. Many underestimate the importance of Chinese key opinion leaders (KOL) and influencers, given that they help brands successfully engage with potential customers on local social media platforms like WeChat. Meanwhile, companies waste millions of dollars with \u201cclassic\u201d advertising in China instead of fully embracing digital methods that produce a measurable ROI. Creating the wrong type of content not only wastes money on bad methods, but brands can\u2019t even measure whether or not that marketing has lead to any significant sales.", "3. Underestimating the power of brands in China", "Chinese consumers love brands because they identify with them. That\u2019s why brand storytelling is much more important in China than in any other place in the world. Yet despite this, most brands do not create an end-to-end brand experience for Chinese consumers. With few exceptions, they focus on selling and not on creating an experience across all touch points. That requires a thorough brand audit, a positioning exercise, and a customer journey assessment. Without perfect brand storytelling at each interaction point, luxury brands will lose the Chinese consumer, without exception. It\u2019s surprising that luxury brands aren\u2019t rigorous about experience creation. Chinese millennials are more discerning in China than in other countries, yet they are not serviced better.", "4. Not being digital enough", "Some brands have a CRM (customer relationship management) system, but it\u2019s handled by customer service, while others have a CRM online, but one that isn\u2019t at all related to store visits. In other words, many brands do not use their most valuable asset: data about their consumers. And by not using their data, they are not servicing their consumers sufficiently. Therefore, by not being digital enough, they create inferior consumer experiences. This is positively the kiss of death in China. Everything MUST be digital there. In all cases, a digital infrastructure must be designed and deployed that connects all data \u2014 including sales data \u2014 and uses advanced data querying methods to create highly personalized experiences that feel luxurious. Only digital means can do that today.", "5. There is no free lunch", "Launching in China without a budget and just hoping you\u2019ll attract hundreds of millions of millennials in China is a guarantee for failure. Weak brands in China with bad economics, unprofitable store locations, and expensive overhead costs will infinitely weaken a brand, and in such scenarios, the brand\u2019s best talent will quit, further accelerating its downfall. Investing in the perfect launch, after thorough brand and strategy development, is absolutely necessary. For many luxury companies, China has become their biggest headache and correcting mistakes winds up being much more expensive than if they\u2019d done it right from the beginning.", "In short, brands need to rethink their approach when it comes to understanding China and its millennial consumers. They need to become consumer-centric, meaning that they must create relevant content and build a strong brand identity. That requires a strong story and a rigorous customer journey design. They also need to become digital: If they think they are already digital, then they need to become even more digital. And they definitely can\u2019t launch in China without investing first. This is the only way to have a chance at success in this highly competitive market.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm \u00c9quit\u00e9.

To be more precise, it\u2019s the most important market for luxury brands to find, select, and connect with the right KOL. This is still quite a challenge for many Western companies that are trying to market to Chinese consumers. But why do Chinese consumers rely so much on influencers in the first place? The answer can be broken down into three main reasons.", "First, China is the youngest and most digital-oriented luxury market. Consumers get most of their information about brands from Chinese social platforms like WeChat, and the nature of those platforms makes it more likely that consumers in China will connect with influencer content than in other countries in which websites and reviews play more prominent roles. Plus, firewalled platforms like WeChat make it difficult for brands to connect directly with consumers on social media \u2014 so KOL-driven content gives them much more visibility.", "Second, Chinese consumers go to social media ahead of any other type of platform to make their luxury purchase decisions. They\u2019ve grown comfortable with receiving guidance from influencers they follow, even if they know that all of the most relevant KOLs have highly paid contracts with large international brands like Christian Dior, Est\u00e9e Lauder, or Gucci, to name a few. It\u2019s all about emulating the lifestyle of their idols, following their advice, and becoming part of their communities.", "Third, many Chinese consumers are still relatively new to the luxury market. They\u2019re looking for guidance and typically trust KOLs more than the information they receive directly from brands.", "To recap, influencers give consumers direction, inspiration, and curation. They help them to navigate through the quickly changing luxury market \u2014 to know which items are \u201chot,\u201d which sneakers are coolest, or which bag or jacket is best. A KOL\u2019s influence goes far beyond the celebrity endorsements that western brands like Rolex or Aston Martin have used over the decades in Western markets. By following a KOL, consumers receive all types of appropriate advice, such as how to dress in a specific situation or which hotel is best to stay in on a specific vacation. While Western celebrity endorsements seem to simply connect their image to a brand, KOLs bring brands into particular and personal contexts. That is their greatest power in influencing Chinese consumers.", "How then, you may ask, should luxury brands select the right influencer? The most important aspect is how a brand\u2019s equity and market positioning fits with the influencer\u2019s image. This sounds logical, but I\u2019m surprised at how few brands have systems in place to help them make these selections in a precise, risk-averse way. The first step is understanding how Chinese consumers see the brand, which in turn requires brand audits combined with advanced consumer listening capabilities that dig deeper than the relatively closed-off Chinese social media networks. Similarly, this exercise should be done with a group of potential influencers to learn who is following them, how they are seen, and which conversations they\u2019re connected to. In the end, the brand has to match the influencer.", "Once a match is found, the right content strategy needs to be developed. Then the brand should use AI-based data analytics to measure exactly how the influencer campaign is resonating with consumers by tracking actual sales back to the influencer. An integrated data ecosystem ultimately lets the brand evaluate if it has chosen the right influencer or created the right communication content.", "Given the importance of KOLs in China, it\u2019s surprising that companies rely more on gut feeling when selecting influencers and content rather than data-driven decision-making. KOLs aren\u2019t just \u201cnice to have\u201d in China \u2014 they\u2019re one of the most important marketing tools in the country today, and as such, they need to be managed much more precisely than most brands realize.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm\u00c9quit\u00e9.

It will be exciting to see if other brands adopt this model.", "While the product portfolio has not yet been revealed, I expect a fusion of high-end tailoring with workout and streetwear that vaults athleisure into the luxury segment. LVMH announced that the brand\u2019s management team would be multicultural as a way to connect with globalized consumers who get inspiration from all areas and cultures. It will also be the first luxury brand created and led by millennials.", "A new digital-first luxury fashion brand that\u2019s run by a young, female musician and influencer reflects consumers\u2019 changing expectations for luxury. But it also brings up interesting questions about the Chinese market and how it will affect the future of luxury. China\u2019s luxury consumers are all digital natives, the youngest in the world, the majority of them are female, and KOLs and influencers drive their brand preferences: attributes that are eerily similar to those of the Fenty brand. I believe the model LVMH is creating could be a blueprint for new luxury Maisons in the future.", "A theoretical digital luxury brand from China that employs a Chinese millennial influencer to direct it and focuses on Chinese consumer tastes could be the next brand-building venture for LVMH or another luxury company. Since China is now the most significant luxury market and initiates most luxury trends today, I would not be surprised to see this China-focused approach unveiled soon.", "But unlike Fenty, I would expect such a brand to be even younger (focused on Generation Z) and centered around wearables and technology with native distribution in all relevant Chinese social media networks and e-commerce platforms. To develop such a brand, fundamentals like rigorous brand positioning, a customer journey strategy, and a luxury strategy must be implemented. With the opportunity to start from scratch, I would expect this brand to use the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies to link consumer consent with digital activation and digital sales strategies.

So to win in China is to position your company quite well for years to come.", "Why is this? China is now the youngest global luxury market. Around 80 percent of their luxury goods are purchased by consumers below the age of 40 (Millennials and Generation-Zers) compared to only about 45 percent across the rest of the globe. These consumers are better educated than previous generations, are digitally native, and grew up without any financial worry or constraints. And consumers there, especially in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, have a significant disposable income and inherit their wealth much earlier.", "Because of their youth and digital lifestyles, luxury brands cannot rely on strategies that were developed for older markets, and in many ways, the China market is more open to disruption and new technologies than older markets. What we see there is a blueprint for what we can expect to experience in Europe and the U.S. a few years down the road. But what are these young Chinese consumers looking for? Surprisingly, they honestly prefer originality and authenticity \u2014 they don\u2019t want brands that get complacent, copy others, or lag behind. They want brands that lead.", "Let\u2019s look at the luxury automobile industry as an example. One successful luxury entrepreneur from China in his early 20s recently said that he wouldn\u2019t even consider a traditional luxury car brand like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, or BMW anymore, as he felt those brands were stuck in the past and were no longer innovative or technically credible. He wondered aloud why they were so reluctant to adapt to electric and self-driving technologies and why their electric cars weren\u2019t the best in terms of acceleration and range. To him, most traditional luxury car brands were not inspiring anymore, and he said he would only buy a new car that felt innovative and future-oriented.", "It\u2019s clear that drastically different thinking and decisive change is needed to appeal to young, urban, and wealthy Chinese consumers, and for incumbent luxury brands, the time to act is now. Following the lead of smarter companies won\u2019t be enough. New electric premium and luxury car brands like Tesla, Nio, Arcfox, Byton, Lagonda, and Pininfarina realize that they have a significant opportunity right now.", "But there is an additional threat to traditional luxury brands that comes from outsiders: brands that have excellent products and customer experiences from other categories like Apple and Dyson. There have been persistent rumors that Apple is preparing an electric car launch. Apple\u2019s expertise in creating an integrated platform around the user and their proven ability to merge design, user interface, technology, and media content remains practically unmatched. An Apple car could possibly threaten the position of legacy brands by accelerating the disruption in the premium and luxury car market.", "Meanwhile, Dyson, a maker of high-end vacuum cleaners, already proved their ability to successfully disrupt entire categories, and they\u2019ve announced that they\u2019ll launch several electric cars within the next few years \u2014 something that should worry traditional car brands. Dyson already said China will be a key market for them, and that they\u2019ll sell their cars at existing stores in China.", "But traditional luxury carmakers have also been hurting themselves. They\u2019ve relied too much on their products and have neglected the luxury brand buying experience. At showrooms and dealerships today, only new brands are credibly delivering true luxury experiences to customers; brands like Genesis and Nio, both of which stand out in the luxury experience-creation category thus far. Remarkably, no traditional luxury car brand has a convincing dealership experience these days. Some incumbent luxury brand experiences are not significantly different from those of mass-market brands, and they\u2019re sometimes even below mass-market standards. This will not be enough to compete in the future, especially for discerning Chinese consumers that move on fast when they\u2019re not convinced.", "Young Chinese luxury consumers have expectations and a level of sophistication that exceeds any previous generation in that country. They work long hours and have significant commutes, so acquiring unique luxury experiences provides an escape from the stress of their daily lives. Anyone that has visited any luxury mall in Shanghai, Beijing, or Guangzhou can confirm that the quality, product displays, and in-store experiences exceed almost any other destination in the world. Why? Because young Chinese luxury consumers are highly educated, digitally native, and come with bigger expectations.", "Brands have to act fast in order to survive \u2014 much less lead \u2014 in China. New approaches to the traditional in-store experience are needed in order to offer consumers there a seamless and integrated digital journey. The aim is to create a branded, end-to-end luxury experience that is distinct across all touchpoints. Thinking needs to shift in a radical way so as to make the consumer the center of all activities. This requires real-time consumer insight generation and processing \u2014 a major weakness for most luxury brands today. But data means nothing if it is not rigorously applied to outstanding consumer experiences.

Luxury brands \u2014 including some of the most successful in the world \u2014 have yet to exploit their potential in China and in the rest of the Asian region. Recently, Prada blamed the slowing Chinese economy for their malaise, but to me, it sounds like an excuse to mask weaknesses in brand execution. The real reasons for poor performance in the China market are usually a lack of precise and timely consumer insights and the willingness to translate those insights into approaches that express the global brand positioning in an authentic and relevant way to Chinese consumers.", "Let\u2019s start with insights, something most companies just haven\u2019t gathered before starting to do business in China. As an example, a famous European luxury fashion house wanted to analyze why some of their results in Asia were less than satisfying. How were they underwhelming? It turns outs, in a surprising amount of ways.", "First of all, the majority of this luxury brand\u2019s consumers were still 45 years old and up, meaning they were unable, for some reason, to reach the huge Chinese Millennial and Gen Z markets. Secondly, the customers who purchased the brand\u2019s most iconic and traditional product lines were even older, while their younger customers were buying less branded, entry-level products and showed a lot less brand loyalty. In other words: The brand\u2019s top customers were very old and slowly dying out! Another important observation: Consumers with the highest spends (over $10k per purchase) were leaving the brand, while newly acquired consumers were spending below $3k on average. Therefore, some basic math can show us that as older customers die, the brand is becoming less profitable. And lastly, many store locations were losing money due to high operational costs in China.", "Oddly, these trends were a big contrast to what the brand was experiencing in their European and American markets. To get real answers, the brand needed to use real-time consumer data to figure out exactly what was going on. Make no mistake, this is a challenging task in China since local online networks are firewalled. But after applying and analyzing data using advanced social media listening engines on all relevant brand conversations, on Chinese social media networks and blogs, we were quickly able to identify important ways in which the brand was being negatively impacted:", "1. Brand positioning was not relevant for Asian consumers", "It became quickly apparent that brand messaging was not resonating with Chinese consumers. First of all, while the brand\u2019s positioning existed in brand manuals and in the heads of the brand\u2019s leadership team, consumers didn\u2019t understand it properly and described the brand differently. This is one of the most typical findings in our work: a mismatch between what management teams believe and what consumer perception is.", "This is even more prevalent in China. I can\u2019t state enough that Chinese consumers perceive brands differently to western consumers: They buy into brands first and then buy their products. But if the brand is not defined sharply enough or understood in an intended way, then they see no reason to buy. Another way to put it is that the brand has to come first, and in the luxury fashion case I described, the positioning was too vague \u2014 we could precisely identify through AI-powered social media measurement. Sometimes it\u2019s very simple to see: If nothing specific shows up, then there are no particular conversations about the brand. Having hard data helped management understand this and made it easier for them to change the strategic approach.", "2. Communication content was irrelevant", "Using digital data querying tools, we could also identify that most of the brand\u2019s marketing efforts in the region did not yield results. Their message was not relevant, the content did not resonate, consumers never became engaged, and no communities were built around the brand. We recommended a radically different communication approach, but we did not recommend changing the brand positioning \u2014 simply to make it clearer, close positioning gaps, and communicate the brand in a more understandable and authentic way for local consumers.", "One of the most significant misconceptions for brands wanting to do business in China is explaining to them that they don\u2019t need a different brand, but a different expression of the original brand position. If it\u2019s more of a global positioning problem, we work with headquarters to strengthen the global brand first before adopting a regional approach. If the company\u2019s content is irrelevant in China, then communicating it means wasting money while watering down the brand, not strengthening it. This is why clear content \u2014 in every market \u2014 is so important.", "3. Competitors were communicating with the target consumers in a better way", "Many brands simply focus on their own story and don\u2019t bother to see where their brand fits amongst the competition. In a time when campaigns are increasingly digital, it can be difficult for companies to ascertain when and how competitors are \u201chighjacking\u201d their consumers. The only way to know is to use AI-powered consumer analysis with machine learning capabilities that will alert your company when triggers occur. And the competition should always be monitored in real time so that a company can recognize exactly when consumers gravitate towards or away from the brand.", "In the case of our top luxury fashion brand, it was these types of competitor actions that had the most substantial impact on their poor regional results. This came at a major surprise to the top management team and triggered the largest strategy shift after our analysis was presented.", "If there\u2019s one major takeaway these findings point toward, it\u2019s that taking action before understanding the root cause of a problem won\u2019t solve anything. It will simply consume time and money, while discouraging your team and giving an edge to the competition.

Questions about where materials come from, the quality of colors and dyes used, and how workers are treated during the production process are just a few of the issues brands now need to answer. And the answer should better be that the entire process of sourcing and production has been holistically aligned and meticulously controlled. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Herm\u00e8s faced massive social media scrutiny for alleged mistreatment of crocodiles that were the source of the leather in some of their most famous bags.

First, luxury has to offer a unique experience, which in most cases is done by outperforming other brands in the segment, in at least one area. For example, a luxury handbag may be available in a rare leather that requires specialized training to handmake the bag. I call these extreme performance points, and when things get extreme, it\u2019s often difficult to produce or consume them in a truly sustainable fashion.", "When we look at this from a different perspective, the dilemma becomes more pronounced. If we want to create a product that\u2019s sustainable \u2014\u00a0in all aspects \u2014 there is a good chance that the performance may suffer and that the product will no longer be identified as a real luxury. And a brand that is not perceived as luxury does not provide consumers with what we call \u201cAdded Luxury Value,\u201d such as social status, enhanced attractiveness, ultimate experiences, and an unforgettable treat. When these effects are missing, the willingness to pay such high prices decreases and people walk away. How can this be solved?", "1. Luxury brands and products need to be luxury first", "This sounds silly, but in my experience, it\u2019s the point where most mistakes are made. When the sum of its parts is not perceived as luxury, people won\u2019t pay the enormous premium. Brands fail, products won\u2019t be sold. The luxury experience has to be at the center of all activities. BMW had to learn this lesson the hard way, when their electric models flopped. Despite several hundred million dollars in investment in highly-sustainable production facilities and sustainable materials in the cars, the \u201cfeel\u201d of both the i8 sports car and the i3 urban car was not seen as a luxury or even premium by many. The i3 could not compete in terms of range with vehicles that were sold at much lower price points, while the i8 was not competitive in acceleration versus a Tesla Model S. Hence, with reduced performance and experience, the cars remained exotic but could hardly be seen anywhere.", "2. Create a sustainable business model", "Once the extreme performance points of luxury are defined, brands need to come up with a holistic end-to-end strategy of how to produce that performance with the least impact on the environment. This is an excellent opportunity to innovate and differentiate. I encourage my clients to think out-of-the-box and see sustainability as the enabler. In times of super-empowered, well-informed consumers, greenwashing is not an option for any company. It is crucial to think of the business model in totality and find ways to improve continually.", "3. Be bold \u2014 challenge and talk about actions", "Many companies are silent when it comes to sustainability. Sustainability efforts are communicated to investors and shareholders, and in an abstract way to consumers, but few companies understand the power of actively talking about sustainability. Stella McCartney, for example, is one of the few who has advocated for sustainable fashion and who has challenged her competition to follow her lead. Consumers look for brands that take a stance and take actions \u2014\u00a0so be bold!", "So many seasoned managers are still skeptical about sustainable luxury. While they publicly embrace the idea, on a corporate level, they don\u2019t believe that sustainability sells when you talk to them off the record. But with millennial and Generation Z consumers becoming such a strong shopping segment, this reluctant approach is dangerous, as it does not match their expectations.

Most importantly, at all times consumers need to feel that the brand is in love with them, too. If they have the impression, that the relationship is not essential to the brand, they will break up. And when they break up \u2014 like in real life \u2014 love can turn into hate, and those consumers, who were the most vocal advocates, will now turn sour and be lost. There is no exception to the rule, and in my experience, this is where many luxury brands fail.", "We find in our work with luxury brands across industries that although all managers know about the importance of customer experience management, they often underestimate the intense love relationship that customers have with their brands. Hence, while they may be good at some consumer touch points, they usually do not manage the customer journey appropriately or don\u2019t pay enough attention to specific details.", "Two examples come to my mind: first, a leading luxury hotel chain that invested a high double-digit dollar amount (north of $50 million) in renovating their flagship hotel. After the renovation, customer satisfaction was at an all-time low. Reason: they still had the same staff and did not train them to upgrade their service with the upgraded facility. Result: a mismatch between higher consumer expectations and unchanged service. The result \u2014 a broken love relationship, unhappy customers, more than $50 million wasted until the staff was trained to perform in an elevated way across every touch point. A second example, an iconic Swiss watch company that is seen by many as the pinnacle of luxury in mechanical wristwatches. A friend of mine in Hong Kong bought one of their flagship models, and a screw in the automatic movement loosened and severely damaged it. My friend, an influential, avid watch collector with an impressive collection of some of the rarest and most beautiful mechanical timepieces tried unsuccessfully to get help from the brand. Messages and emails were unanswered. Finally, they suggested that he was responsible for the loose screw inside of the movement until he came to a point where his love for the brand turned into deep disappointment. Their lack of compassion, customer service, and solution resulted in him always complaining about the brand and not buying anymore from them. I estimate that the brand lost more than $100,000 of future revenue with him, and even worse, since he is telling his story to everyone in his influential circle, a lot of potential buyers in China and Hong Kong may not buy the brand given his experience.", "In both cases, consumers did not feel loved \u2014 in both instances underestimating the power of the love relationship and not having the right tools in place caused damage to the brand. So, what should brands do?", "1. Define an authentic positioning", "When we identify gaps for our clients in customer journeys and brand experiences, we usually see that issues start with an insufficient definition of the brand. When we apply our luxury brand model, most of the time, while brand equity seems healthy at first glance, we find gaps especially in the emotional core of the brands. In other words, the ability to inspire consumers. And inspiration is the basis for a love relationship. This goes beyond the \u201cwhy\u201d question. Only when brands are sharply defined and when this definition can be condensed and explained with a few simple words, then consumers will relate to it. In China, where the majority of luxury consumers are under 40 years old and digitally native, any brand positioning that needs more than 5 seconds to understand will fail. And a brand that is not recognized will never be perceived as relevant and authentic. In my experience, an appropriate brand equity aspiration and definition is an area that is strongly underestimated for China, especially by global brands that often rely on their worldwide playbook and then wonder why the results in China are disappointing.", "2. Understand how your brand is perceived", "Most brands rely on traditional market research or basic digitally-generated consumer insights. In China, this is not sufficient and will lead to failure. It is crucial to have a real-time grasp on which conversations are going on around the brand, how consumer consent is shifting and how the communication of the brand is shaping perceptions. Basic heatmaps and social listening tools are not sufficient, especially since most standard tools are breaking down with the firewalled Chinese Internet. Implementing an appropriate digital infrastructure, which should include advanced data querying and AI, and that works with Chinese consumers is indispensable. I am surprised how often I hear managers asking, do we need that? Launching in China without a clear, automatically updating data set on how consumers talk about the brand means launching in a black box and hoping for good results. Good luck with that.", "3. Create communities and spread the love", "Once the brand is defined in an authentic and relevant way for Chinese consumers and the infrastructure is in place to have a real-time view on consumers, it is all about building communities and providing excellent service. In my point of view, traditional advertising in China is a waste of money and should be replaced by targeted digital advertising, because it is the only way to create communities of brand lovers. With the help of KOLs (key opinion leaders), those communities can be nurtured and developed. In the best case, brands create a platform for ongoing consumer interactions in both dimensions, and this also requires advanced CRM systems. Of course, managing communities also means on a broader scale, optimizing every touch point, training staff according to the brand positioning developed before and ensuring that the love relationship is strengthened touch point by touch point.", "When consumers fall in love, this has more profound implications than what is apparent at first glance. And managing hundreds, thousands and millions of love relationships at the same time is not easy and requires utmost precision. To succeed in China, advanced technology and the right combination of luxury strategies and tools is a precondition, it is not an option. And it prepares companies for the future. Because what happens now in China is anticipating how increasingly young and digital consumers will make their brand choices worldwide.", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the\u00a0luxury, lifestyle and consumer\u00a0brand strategy firm\u00a0\u00c9quit\u00e9.

It\u2019s important to note that a luxury brand must first be perceived as \u201cluxury\u201d without compromise, but then sustainability has become an essential next purchase driver, especially for younger consumers. That gives brands an opportunity to disrupt by positioning themselves at the forefront of the ethical, guilt-free luxury products that younger luxury buyers clearly want.", "That\u2019s why I am personally so excited about the Italian car design firm Pininfarina\u2019s decision to launch the Battista: an electric hypercar that eclipses anything before in automotive history, but with a carbon footprint comparable to a Toyota Prius. This week, Pininfarina invited me to give a keynote address about the power of sustainable luxury at its New York City unveiling event, in front of a hand-selected group of customers, sustainability ambassadors, and journalists covering the luxury, business, and automotive industries.", "There I mentioned that the term \u201chypercar\u201d might not even fully describe this car well enough, as the specs are nothing less than a breakthrough in automotive performance: 1,900 horsepower, more than 2.300N.m of torque unleashed by four dedicated electric engines that power each wheel, and an acceleration speed that has only been experienced by driving a Formula One racing car \u2014 and it\u2019s all packed into a beautiful design with a luxurious, refined interior. The Battista moves the needle of what car luxury means to a different level, and it does this while producing zero-emissions. \u201cultracar\u201d is a more appropriate term for it, and the few lucky owners of this exclusive car can enjoy its exhilarating driving experience guilt-free.", "It was exciting to watch the Battista go from a concept, to what was then shown weeks ago in Geneva, and now to its first appearance in America. That\u2019s because many of the existing hyper-car companies have no clear EV (electric vehicle) strategy or showcase only future EV concepts, most of which never see the road. In contrast, Pininfarina has a car that is already driving on the streets of New York and is exciting both bystanders, who saw it zooming by, and police, who also noticed the car and stopped it several times during its test drive because they wanted to see it close up.", "And seeing is believing! The team around CEO Michael Perschke \u2014 including chief brand officer Dan Connell, legendary designer Luca Borgogno, program director Rene Wollmann, and test driver and Formula One and Formula E pilot Nick Heidfeld \u2014 did not compromise on any amount of luxury, performance, or comfort for this car, and this, to me, is crucial. That\u2019s because luxury must first attract people in a clear and uncompromising way before it can inspire them to change the way they think. And this change can help create a lasting movement around sustainable luxury that will go far beyond the 150 future owners of the car. In this way, Pininfarina can aid in changing people\u2019s views about luxury cars \u2014 and specifically ultracars\u00a0\u2014 that will lead to an increased demand for high-performance cars without emissions.", "In a growing number of countries car companies now need to indicate how efficient their models are with a traffic-light system that goes from green to red. Not surprisingly, most traditional gasoline-powered, high-performance luxury cars are still classified as dark red, and in many places, they are subject to a \u201cgas guzzler\u201d tax. Sustainable luxury like the Battista will make consumers aware that extreme performance can be green, too. Over time, this will have a significant influence on which luxury brands people choose.", "In China, I predict that cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou will soon restrict internal combustion engines as the only way to solve their increasing pollution problem. Norway is already phasing out gasoline cars, with France, the UK, and other regions around the world soon to change their legislation. By educating consumers on the possibility of new, superior, and more sustainable technologies, Pininfarina won\u2019t only shift the way people think, they\u2019ll also inspire other car companies to accelerate their emission-free developments. There\u2019s a profound disruption happening in the luxury car industry, and only brands that embrace change will stay relevant.", "Now that customers can see what\u2019s possible with EV cars, expectations will shift. Given that China is the largest EV market and is home to the youngest luxury consumers (who are highly receptive to new technologies), I predict the Battista will be well received among wealthy Chinese consumers and further accelerate China\u2019s global leadership role in EV adoption. And, ideally, this will encourage other luxury brands across industries like fashion, handbags, luggage, furniture, and more to rethink how they can disrupt their own categories by creating more sustainable business models.

They are known worldwide for curating luxury sales; when Sotheby\u2019s decides to include an item in an auction, that item instantly becomes luxury, even if a potential buyer isn\u2019t familiar with its particular category. As an example, I went to the auction house\u2019s fine wine auction after the conference and was introduced to wines I might never have otherwise considered.", "Sotheby\u2019s distinguished and orderly presentation of brands and products, the use of timeless high-end d\u00e9cor, the discreet professionalism of the staff, and the hand-picked selection of beautiful objects \u2014 from jewelry to fine art \u2014 all underline how the auction house has mastered the art of creating a luxury experience. As someone who is frequently invited to luxury events around the world and advises top managers of luxury brands on best practices for luxury events, I still found myself impressed at how incredibly luxurious \u2014 yet accessible \u2014 the auction felt.", "But what really surprised me was the extent to which Sotheby\u2019s has transformed itself into a digital powerhouse. David made an interesting point during our discussion: Almost all luxury discoveries begin online today. And although the physical auction still allows bidders to get inspired and to immerse themselves in the objects, a significant amount of bidding is now done online. As Sotheby\u2019s has grown into an online marketplace, the company has much greater precision in terms of planning, pricing, and curating shows. Operating with data that follows the customer journey across all touchpoints takes the guesswork out of decision-making, or what David described as using \u201cdata versus anecdotes.\u201d", "The use of machine learning, pattern recognition, and AI helps the company identify hidden luxury drivers \u2014 a point I have been passionate about in my own luxury research. Data analytics revealed, for instance, that paintings featuring red and blue achieve higher prices than paintings with other color schemes. This data allows for much higher precision in terms of curating luxury, pricing it, and creating a digitized experience that the customer can enjoy. While Swiss watch companies struggle to sell new watches online and even lose consumers to resellers that have a larger digital footprint than the brands, David confirmed that, on the Sotheby\u2019s website, all luxury categories sell equally. That\u2019s because their brand has become known for always offering highly-curated, quality shows across all categories.", "What can luxury brands learn from Sotheby\u2019s digital focus?

So not having a powerful, highly-sophisticated CRM that begins at the first contact with a customer means neglecting that first digital impression.

And once the relationship starts, rigorous data-management can help to identify when to interact and which content to use.", "Because this data allows businesses to create more relevant content, it also helps brands feel more authentic, which is a precondition to buying for millennials and Generation Zers in China.

Talking with local managers, I often hear complaints that they have to use material that doesn\u2019t resonate with local audiences, especially not with Chinese millennials. While many brands use local agencies to create social media content for China, they have major shortcomings. First of all, Chinese consumers access brands in a different way than Western consumers. Western brands usually define the brand image as the sum of their products, launches, and campaigns, but brand image and position is much more important in China.", "So when we work with luxury brands that try to launch or accelerate their business in China, we first assess brand positioning by looking for gaps and building a compelling brand story that resonates with Chinese consumers.

China literally and figuratively views your brand differently", "Chinese consumers access brands in a different way than Western consumers, who understand a brand via their multiple parts. So in Europe or the U.S., a Porsche campaign for the 911 will shape how consumers perceive the Porsche brand as a whole. Similarly, individual initiatives or launches, like Louis Vuitton\u2019s collaboration with a company like Supreme, will shape the perception of the LV brand for Western consumers. But Chinese consumers are entirely different. They want to understand the entire brand and its history first. Only then, if it resonates with them, will they consider any offshoots or collaborations. When brands approach us, we first do an AI-powered brand scan where we assess how well the brand\u2019s market position is defined.", "In most cases, even with iconic, globally successful brands, we identify significant room for position improvement. For example, if a luxury car brand tells me their positioning is on point because they\u2019re selling a \u201cdream-car,\u201d their design is distinct, and they offer extraordinary performance, I remind their CEOs that this is what all luxury car brands should offer. Brands need to be much more precise and differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace if they want to be successful.", " 3. Know how to deliver your message", "The way in which Chinese consumers access, process, perceive and share content is entirely different than Western consumers. Chinese websites look different because consumers are used to a different look and feel. Page scrolling, which is typical for Western sites, doesn\u2019t work with Chinese consumers. Content on Western social media like Facebook or Instagram won\u2019t work at all or will be irrelevant to Chinese consumers, and many Western websites can\u2019t even be accessed from China. Without a proper WeChat strategy, Western brands won\u2019t get any traction there.", "Another issue is that most Western data analytics tools aren\u2019t able to capture the full picture behind Chinese consumers, and if CRM (Customer-Relationship Management) tools are not designed to accompany those analytic tools across various sales points, then significant opportunities are lost or mismanaged.", "We developed a different approach that emphasizes a holistic brand strategy and equally addresses these three major pitfalls. We enable our clients to operate all areas of their business from a rigorously data-driven perspective that includes everything from strategy development and brand maximization to the utilization of ongoing real-time insights that optimize everything from marketing to management. In my experience, this approach is a game changer and indispensable for continued success in China.", "How does it work? We connect all the available data \u2014 social platforms, CRM, sales, finance, and after-sales databases \u2014 to create one integrated data platform.

What Sotheby\u2019s is now doing, in reality, is to curate luxury and even create luxury. In my luxury management books, I define luxury as rare, hedonic, difficult to consume and acquire, a provider of extraordinary experiences, a social marker, and differentiator, and an item that enhances the social position of the owner. Part of the allure of luxury is that when it comes to the most luxurious products, they all have two things in common: First, they are scarce, often there have only been a few produced or few remain, ideally one. Second, there is a unique story connected to them, whether this is a historic moment, an adventure, or the connection to a historical and famous person.", "Being rare and hard to find (hence, difficulty in acquiring) and in need of a good story is where Sotheby\u2019s comes in. By carefully identifying objects of desire that have a history and a story and uniquely organizing collections, the auction house becomes much more than a selling platform: it becomes a storyteller and curator. This has always been important. But especially nowadays, where luxury consumers are younger than ever before. The role of Sotheby\u2019s is to inspire millennial consumers, who are relatively new to many of the categories about what luxury is. By this, Sotheby\u2019s becomes something like a commander-in-chief of luxury. This connection of vintage wine, a classic painting, or a piece of historic jewelry to a 25-year-old millennial consumer is shaping the perception of luxury for the top 0.1 percent of consumers.", "", "At the same time, millennials are shaping the way in which Sotheby\u2019s has to market their auctions and curate the items. As for millennials, especially in Asia, life has become digital, the curation of auctions and the connection with millennials bidders is becoming digital too. And since the taste and lifestyle of a 29-year-old urban tech billionaire from Southeast China will be very different from the taste of a 74-year-old oil billionaire living in a mega mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, Sotheby\u2019s need to curate differently to be relevant to the hip, cool, cosmopolitan lifestyle that millennials are looking for.", "But it also has challenges. Because millennials are the most challenging luxury consumers ever: They are super-empowered, digitally savvy, and, in my experience, the most demanding generation ever. They demand perfection in the customer journey \u2014 they get bored easily \u2014 as they have experienced much more than any generation before. Hence, addressing them with relevant content, curating suitably, and inspiring them with topics that they deem important is crucial.", "Therefore, for auction houses like Sotheby\u2019s, a regular assessment of brand positioning, customer journey, and its resonance with millennial consumers is indispensable, as well as generating real-time insights about consumers \u2014 their tastes, their conversations, and their lifestyles. When we work with luxury and lifestyle brands, we discourage the use of traditional market research, as it is not fast and precise enough. Instead, we focus on advanced data querying; social listening and AI-based analytics, connecting trends and consumer consent with sales that will drive the future of curating luxury experiences.", "The auction in Hong Kong will again reveal a fascinating interaction where the expertise of Sotheby\u2019s is shaping the tastes of millennial luxury buyers, and millennials, in turn, are shaping how and what Sotheby\u2019s curates and how Sotheby\u2019s communicates by increasingly utilizing digital touch points.

Given the exorbitant rent at this prime location and the high cost of running the place (personnel, maintenance, decoration, inventory, etc.), foot traffic and in-store sales weren\u2019t high enough to make the flagship profitable. There were indications from the store that the majority of visitors and consumers who visited were over 40. In short, the store was lacking in millennials and younger Generation-Z consumers. This is typical for many luxury (and non-luxury) brands, so you\u2019re probably familiar with the issue.", "But what can be done? The classic approach is to question everything about the store itself \u2014 to consider a store redesign, switch out the merchandise, re-train the staff, or other possible options. The brand had a lot of hypotheses about their \u201cyouth traffic\u201d problem, but the management team was unsure about the root cause and remedy.", "I decided to address this challenge from a different angle: by using AI. The objective was to gain fundamental insights about how consumers see the brand instead of merely speculating about what they were thinking. As we all know, millennials and Gen-Zers are digital natives, particularly in China. Their lives are entirely digitally based, their conversations are online, and their first point of access to brands is via their phone. This even applies to ultra-luxury brands. That doesn\u2019t mean that stores are pointless; stores are actually essential in helping customers experience a brand. They need to see and feel materials and try on clothes. And many seek the recommendations and suggestions they get from trained personnel. But the fundamental decision about which brand to choose is often made before a consumer even enters the store. That moment of truth is now almost entirely digital.", "Therefore, trying to solve a store traffic issue \u2014 or any other brand challenge \u2014 without analyzing the digital conversations about the brand means that you\u2019re ignoring consumers\u2019 top decision-making platform. And this is exactly where AI becomes indispensable. What we did was a process all available data points about the brand, including those of all relevant competitors on social media, blogs, forums, and more. This means processing all conversations and mentions about the brand that were happening online on publicly accessible platforms. Then we used AI and machine learning to identify major relationships, interactions, and patterns about how the brand was seen online. This included filtering out anything that was non-relevant, for example when the brand was mentioned out of context (something that often happens when someone just hashtags a brand to get views but offers no real content). Given this huge amount of data, these processes need to be run in an automated way. And then finally, we used our expertise on luxury strategy to interpret this data and determine how to best solve the issue.", "How does it work? We looked at the ratio of positive versus negative mentions, compared them with those of competitors, looked in to age-related conversations, and identified which content and which sources are driving conversations, leading to a precise map of how the brand was perceived by target group, regions, gender, age-clusters, buyers of the brand versus competitive buyers, and more. We also identified who the key influencers are, hence who are responsible for how the brand is perceived. This map allowed us to gain a precise, unbiased real-time view about the status of the brand within the competitive field including all major influencing factors. Then, once we had the full picture, we applied our proprietary deep luxury strategy insights (for example, our understanding of what drives consumers\u2019 decisions for or against a purchase, including their willingness to pay).", "What we found surprised not only me, but also the brand\u2019s CEO and his entire leadership team. The issue the brand faced came from an origin that no one had even considered. It was caused by a specific strategy the brand used for years to help increase their revenue, but unfortunately, had enabled competitors \u2014 especially cheaper brands \u2014 to piggyback on the brand\u2019s equity while also siphoning away consumers by redirecting conversations about the brand. In essence, the brand was digitally hijacked because of its actions, and the management was not aware of it. In our experience, this can happen to any brand!", "We also found that the brand\u2019s communication content on social media was not resonating enough with the target group, leading to a competitive disadvantage and poor results. These AI findings indicated that there was a significant opportunity to increase store traffic and revenue while reducing costs by changing the content and the frequency/timing of the brand\u2019s communications. None of this would have come to light by using traditional market research or focusing only on the store in question. AI is a game changer, and its real power is unleashed by combining it with advanced luxury management insights and strategies.", "Millennials are disrupting the status quo of brands, and Gen-Zers will only do it more as they age. AI-based luxury strategies are the only way to generate actionable insights in real time, yet few companies actually learn how to harness the power of the AI they have at their fingertips \u2014 particularly as it pertains to luxury brands. And in China, this is even harder, since a company\u2019s AI technology has to be able to connect to Chinese social media platforms like WeChat.", "AI works because it identifies real drivers or barriers to success \u2014 unbiased and in real-time \u2014 which reveals important insights and patterns.

That in today\u2019s digital \u2014\u00a0everything all of the time \u2014 world, it\u2019s all about connection. While I agreed about the need for immersive consumer experiences, I vehemently disagreed about the importance of the brand. In fact, I couldn\u2019t help but think that managing the equity of a brand has never been as important as it is now. This means creating a proposition that resonates with consumers and inspires them. In short, if a luxury brand wants to entice today\u2019s consumers, whether it\u2019s in China or beyond, it needs to underscore its authenticity and relevancy.", "Powerful words, to be sure, but what does it mean to be authentic and relevant? For the moment, let\u2019s start with the opposite. During many of my brand strategy sessions, I often hear the expression \u201cthey feel staged\u201d when people describe brands that they would never buy. Needless to say, when brand feels staged, it is neither authentic nor relevant. The synonyms unnatural, deceived, cheated, and faked come to mind. In other words, a staged brand is bullshitt*ng their consumers.", "This may sound harsh, but in my experience, this is what consumers perceive if a brand is not authentic. It feels like something is off, even if people can\u2019t tell what it is. And when they feel it, the brand loses relevancy and consumers walk away. Managers of brands typically have the best intentions, but if their proposition is off, if they use the wrong tools, then the brand will feel staged, lacking substance and meaning. And for luxury brands, this perception has three consequences: consumers will not pay premium prices; they will turn away; and they will tell their friends. Social media is a locus of people sharing their experiences, and if they\u2019re negative, they will spread even faster.", "So what\u2019s the root cause of this problem? And why do brands, even some of the most established and successful ones, continue to make these mistakes? First of all, managing luxury brands is difficult. When executed well, however, they can deliver an exponential amount of intangible value, which explains why consumers pay such high prices. But when mistakes are made, the intangible value collapses, which can often be irreversible.", "In my experience, it\u2019s a lack of authenticity and relevancy that starts at the core of the brand; it\u2019s the lack of a comprehensive brand definition that combines a rational reason to be and an emotional anchor for the customer. While brands often think that their definition is clear, in reality, it is often blurry or vague. Many are too similar to what other brands in the same field are claiming or doing. This similarity may feel safe for some managers (\u201cbecause others do the same, there must be a reason, and we should be fine\u201d), but feels staged for consumers (\u201cthe brand does what everyone else is doing\u201d).", "And for a luxury brand, nothing is worse than creating an experience that is no more than a category experience, even if the delivery is flawless. If the experience is not \u201cbranded,\u201d or differentiated in some unique way, it creates no brand equity, no memory, and very little reason to come back. True, most luxury brands have brand manuals. But having a brand manual does not mean that the brand is defined in a way that creates the extreme value that a true luxury brand needs. I often these find brand definitions are too unspecific, relying too much on category norms, and more focused on repeated efficiency rather than on creating relevant and authentic experiences. And if a consumer pays for an experience that turns out not to be authentic, they will feel cheated, bullshi*tted when they have to pay a premium for it.

With this, however, comes more potential for disruption than traditional luxury brands have ever seen, and it\u2019s something they need to prepare for.", "Disruption can give opportunities to companies: a way for them to enter the market at a different angle. That\u2019s exactly what the luxury brand Gray, which was recently founded by two college students in Singapore, has done. The brand\u2019s CEO, Kevin Wu, is hell-bent on bringing radical, future-forward ideas about luxury to his already tech-obsessed generation of consumers. Consequently, his team just launched the first luxury crypto-wallet (in collaboration with Trezor, a maker of cryptocurrency wallet hardware) for items priced at $1,000 or more \u2014 price points that are far above most luxury wallets working with traditional banknotes. At a time when most luxury managers have close to zero experience with cryptocurrencies, young companies like Gray are daring to think differently in order to build up new markets: the definition of disrupting.", "A similar tendency to innovate is currently sweeping through the sneaker market as well. With roots in skateboarding, the Venice Beach-based brand No. One has set themselves up to disrupt the shoe market with their bespoke sneakers made with the finest leathers available and using traditional dress shoemaking techniques. The company\u2019s online collection \u201cdrops\u201d has been selling out in minutes, and their shoes reach consumers from all over the world.", "But this Gen Z-driven sneaker hype is only just beginning. Looking at the ever-increasing offerings from brands like Off-White, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga, and even Adidas and Nike with their high-tech and high-end lines, we get an idea of how much more disruption we should expect in the luxury shoe business in the future. Fortunately for the industry, shoe creativity seems to have no limits. Take Maison Margiela\u2019s dirt sock sneakers, for example \u2014 a shoe that stretches the idea of what most people consider \u201cluxury.\u201d But when I showed them to a sneaker-obsessed Gen-Z friend, she quickly stated, \u201cThey are dope!\u201d", "Maison Margiela dirty sneakers. Photo: Daniel Langer", "Gen Z\u2019s tastes disrupt the luxury business as much as their tech-savvy natives, and those tastes have implications on their point-of-sale preferences. Their feeling is that the time of boring and arrogant luxury stores is over. These \u201ctemples\u201d \u2014 where merchandise is hidden behind glass counters with grim-looking sales personnel hovering around \u2014 are made to impress but not to immerse. Instead, the youngest generation of consumers demands shopping experiences that make them feel comfortable; places that inspire them and where they feel \u201cat home.\u201d Therefore, don\u2019t be surprised that you can now buy ice cream in the luxury shoe store Kith or that you can listen to hip-hop at Opening Ceremony, both of which are major disruptors in Gen Z-oriented luxury retail and are located in New York City. The theory is that if consumers are digital first, then brick-and-mortar stores need to be experiential first, otherwise, they have no reason to exist for these consumers.", "Thus, traditional luxury, premium, and lifestyle brands need to reconsider their approaches when it comes to creating consumer experiences. They also need to beware of ill-considered attempts \u2014 marketing failures will only erode brand equity as they won\u2019t feel authentic to consumers.", "Instead, a company needs to undergo a strict assessment of how they\u2019re positioned in the eyes of consumers. This is not an easy task; even with leading brands, I find a lot of room for improvement. During a recent visit to Adidas\u2019 Hong Kong flagship store, which employs a traditional store layout that\u2019s less contemporary than newer brands, I noticed that it was empty at rush hour, while many Gen Z-geared indie stores nearby were overflowing with shoppers. It\u2019s a clear sign that some sort of action is needed from Adidas.", "But these miscues aren\u2019t limited to sports apparel or sneaker brands. Just a short distance from the Adidas store is Mercedes-Benz\u2019s Hong Kong \u201cMercedes Me\u201d space. Here, the luxury car brand is using a lifestyle concept to try to connect with younger urban consumers in a context that\u2019s vastly different from a traditional car dealership. The idea was to combine a caf\u00e9, a casual restaurant, a car showroom and a retail space for Mercedes-branded accessories into one holistic shopping experience, but what\u2019s striking is how none of these components connect to each other.", "Inside the store, a two-tone $250,000 Mercedes Maybach is squeezed into one corner, looking shockingly miscast given the setting. The caf\u00e9 and restaurant areas feel out-of-place with their strange mixes of colors, materials, and props, most of which have no association with the Mercedes brand. But the worst part is the accessories store, where cheaply-made brand charms and plastic iPhone cases were on offer for about $10. I left feeling completely confused about what the Mercedes brand even stands for \u2014 was this a self-confident luxury brand, a mediocre caf\u00e9, or a cheap accessory shop? There was no \u201cbrand feel\u201d nor was there anything inspiring or authentic. Executions like this won\u2019t give Mercedes an edge in luring a young, urban target group because it makes the brand look disconnected from what younger consumers expect \u2014 and actually get \u2014 from more informed brands.", "Another example of a failed attempt to become more relevant to Gen Z and millennials is the recent launch of Louis Vuitton\u2019s in-ear headphones. In my view, this execution represents a common problem in luxury: Priced at $1,000, the headphones are technically and aesthetically identical to headphones of a common headphone brand, save for an LV sticker glued on them and a pumped-up price of $1,000. That\u2019s a staggering $700 more than an identical brand! There\u2019s neither additional craftsmanship nor anything else that the Louis Vuitton brand adds in terms of value. Because of this, a simple Google search reveals consumer comments decrying the headphones as a \u201cscam.\u201d This isn\u2019t surprising, as the internet\u2019s youngest consumers are also the most discerning. Brand actions like these look desperate while weakening the credibility and equity of the entire brand. It\u2019s good to remember that incompatible line extensions always weaken brand perception \u2014 they are never just neutral. That\u2019s what makes them so dangerous.", "With this in mind, how can a brand best manage disruption from younger consumers? When I advise luxury and lifestyle brands on how to manage a consumer-centric transition, how to increase their relevance among Generation Z and millennials, and how to envision their \u201cstore of the future,\u201d I tell them that their most important need is to have 100-percent clarity about what their brand stands for, both rationally and emotionally. Brands need to first understand how they want to inspire consumers, and then all the following measures and actions must follow those definitions. While it sounds easy to do, I see many brands struggling, especially when it comes to marketing to China\u2019s young and demanding luxury consumers. Their sophistication is often sorely underestimated by traditional brands and managers unfamiliar with the country, which gives a window to authentic new brands that have a genuine Asian mindset and born from within this desirable target group. Those brands are necessarily built around authentic values, so only brands that can create relevant and authentic messaging across all measures and touchpoints will compete with these more authentic and agile brands for Gen Z\u2019s dollars.

Are we facing the big crisis that so many commentators foresee? Should brands even rethink launching in China now? How should luxury brands deal with economic uncertainty?", "Economic uncertainty is nothing new. The term VUCA was created back in 1987 to describe volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of situations. In short, nothing in life is certain. Last week during the holiday, according to the Ministry of Commerce and National Statistics Bureau, spending was up 8.5 percent year-on-year. While below the previous year\u2019s growth rate of 10.2 percent in the same holiday period, it\u2019s still an extraordinary growth rate, far above most other economies in the world. I think it\u2019s important to put this growth into a global perspective: It means that the economic conditions in China are still dramatically more favorable than in many other regions including Europe, the U.S., and Japan, despite decreasing growth rates.", "Should luxury brands be worried about the slowing rate? For sure, it is imperative to have a clear market outlook and to factor economic developments into strategy processes. However, I always warn my clients to rely on economic growth as the primary predictor of future success. Economic growth is just a framework, and high market growth rates are often more dangerous for companies than lower ones. The reason is that in times of double-digit market growth rates, organizations usually get complacent. It\u2019s human nature to attribute externally-driven growth to internal mastery, but when growth rates slow down, the market separates brands that create high brand equity and excellent consumer-centricity from brands that took their success for granted.", "In this respect, slowing growth rates in China should be a wake-up call for brands to check on how well positioned they are and to use the time during a market that\u2019s growing at high single digits to take corrective actions where necessary. Keeping this in mind, here are three essential aspects luxury brands should focus on:", "1.\u00a0 \u00a0 Millennials and Generation Z need to be your number one consideration.", "Why? Because according to Tencent \u2014 the company that runs platforms like WeChat \u2014 millennials were by far the largest spenders during Chinese New Year, followed by Generation Z. This is a paradigm shift from a situation just a few years ago when Gen Z was hardly noticeable in terms of retail spending and millennials were seen as an up-and-coming demographic, but not yet the most important luxury consumer group.", "For brands to be relevant to these target groups means to shift thinking entirely. Many managers are not yet comfortable with this new situation where one thing has drastically changed: Millennials and Gen Zers are digital natives, which also means they are the youngest and best-informed consumers ever. They\u2019re also the most demanding. Brands that do not step up their game in providing luxury experiences will be the ones that lose out the most.", "2.\u00a0 \u00a0 Luxury is all about creating the most value possible for your consumers.", "No touchpoint can be overlooked. From a consumer\u2019s perspective, the entire perceived experience counts. A lot of brands we work with initially believe that it\u2019s sufficient to only optimize one specific aspect of their business, such as revamping the store, changing advertising, or creating social media content. None of this is wrong, but brands should ideally start with a holistic approach that clearly defines major concepts. What does the brand stand for? How does the brand inspire (millennial) consumers? What is the purpose of the brand from a consumer perspective?", "Creating powerful luxury brand equity is the precondition to being successful, especially as competition heats up and consumers become more demanding. Depending on the platform, the customer journey needs to be designed strategically, and all touchpoints must be rigorously planned. The mistake many brands make is to define isolated actions before the brand model is crystal clear and differentiated from the competition. This will create more harm than benefit, often leading to irreversible brand destruction.", "3.\u00a0 \u00a0 You need to listen to your customers 24 hours per day, seven days a week, across all channels, from social media to blogs.", "Measuring consumer sentiment in real time; combining those measurements with other data like sales, order numbers, website visits, store visits, inquiries, etc.; and using artificial intelligence to quickly make sense of this data is a total game changer in managing luxury brands.", "Without it, results become random, innovations could miss the sweet spot, marketing budgets get spent without a clear ROI, and the potential to maximize market activities can\u2019t be fully realized. This doesn\u2019t just represent a missed opportunity to create a competitive advantage \u2014 it ultimately puts the entire brand at risk now that consumer preferences change at ever-accelerating speeds.", "Luxury brands that internalize these three lessons and make the change towards radical customer-centricity have the best position and odds of thriving in a highly competitive market.

Produce Relevance and Content Quality", "According to GroupM, the WeChat search engine favors the most relevant information to the search entry.

Invest in Various Search Properties", "Just as Google sorts its results into categories, WeChat also lists results into different groups of content. For example, a search for \u2018lipsticks\u2019 first offers links to purchase different products, followed by a list of WeChat moments that include the word \u2018lipstick\u2019, a Wikipedia page for \u2018lipstick\u2019, and finally a list of relevant content published by various official WeChat accounts.

We spoke to industry experts who have helped brands get the most out of their WeChat strategy and gotten tips from in-house marketing staff who work for luxury brands.", "Here are the top six misconceptions that brands have about WeChat:", "1. Presence on WeChat is mandatory", "\u201cBrands often approach WeChat with a FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than buckling up with a well-crafted WeChat strategy and follower journey beforehand,\u201d said Preeti Kumar, head of digital strategy at the digital agency 31ten.", "Brands flock to the social media app to have a \u2018presence,\u2019 an official account, where they can contribute \u2018meaningful\u2019 updates hoping to be a part of the organic conversations people are having on WeChat.", "The competitive landscape of WeChat is not what it was four years ago when it first launched. There were 20 million official accounts that are all hoping for the same.", "\u201cUnless you have zeroed in on the specific role WeChat will play in your consumers\u2019 journey, don\u2019t get onto this already highly crowded platform,\u201d said Kumar.", "And investment on WeChat doesn\u2019t come cheap, according to Alexis Bonhomme, the Co-Founder and General Manager of Curiosity China, usually, a reasonable campaign on WeChat will start at about 200,000-300,000 yuan ($30,000-$45,000) while a more comprehensive one will be more in the region of 500,000 yuan ($75,000). This would include a campaign concept, creation and production, and media buying and KOL engagement. If brands go with a smaller budget, then the impact might likewise be smaller.", "2. WeChat is a broadcast medium", "Bringing the traditional media mindset to WeChat, brands often have the misconception that WeChat is a broadcast medium.", "The numbers clearly show how misplaced this belief is. In the second quarter of 2017, the official reading rate on WeChat was 3.18 percent. Judging by this small number, it\u2019s easy to see why the return on investment (ROI) for brands with regard to broadcast content is low.", "On the other hand, WeChat has sophisticated functionalities for brands that they can use to intimately learn about their followers and thereby build a highly personal and relevant WeChat experience.", "\u201cBrands often see WeChat as a PR tool, and build a \u2018digital advertising strategy,\u201d said Bonhomme. \u201cWhat they need is \u2018digital tech\u2019 that involves online-to-offline (O2O), payment, E-CRM, E-commerce, etc.\u201d", "The misconception is further reflected by their hiring decisions for in-house WeChat staff.", "\u201cLuxury brands prioritize aesthetics and brand image, but a lot of them may fall into the rabbit hole of hiring advertising talent,\u201d said Suyu Meng, a WeChat consultant. Meng suggested that brands hire someone that has a basic mindset for digital marketing because the role of WeChat constantly shifts becoming increasingly complex. \u201cThe success of a WeChat campaigns is a combination of content, design, operation and more,\u201d she said.", "\u201cBrands think they can just repurpose and translate content from western social platforms and publish on WeChat,\u201d said Jeff Fish, co-founder of WeChat agency TMG Worldwide, he urged brands not to keep a simple or straightforward strategy on WeChat. \u201cThey need to take their content and make sure it is in the right tone and segmented by audience.\u201d", "3. My WeChat strategy is working if I have a lot of followers", "Brands often erroneously believe that follower count is the sole measurement of success on WeChat. As the ecosystem of WeChat becomes more complex, a single metric, such as your number of followers, is simply not enough.", "Brands looking to leverage WeChat, especially to sell, should be clear on this because even if WeChat accounts have a huge volume of followers, not all followers will translate to sales because not all of them have purchasing power.", "\u201cIf a brand wants to sell products,\u201d said Jenny Chen, COO at WalktheChat, \u201cKOL is a much better method.\u201d Though the pricing of working with a KOL varies, it could range from $100-$50,000, depending on the goals that brands are trying to achieve.", "4. WeChat is a sales tool", "\u201cShort-term quarterly focus and incentives to meet the sales targets can often make CMOs approach WeChat content as a sales incentivizing tactic,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cThis leads to producing very salesy content that says, \u2018Look at me! I am so pretty! Buy now!!\u2019 That stuff is a big turn-off for readers.\u201d", "It comes as no surprise that the No.1 reason cited for unsubscribing from a WeChat account,\u201d according to a 2016 WeChat Behavior Study\u00a0by\u00a0Globeone, is this: It is boring.", "Though there is a reason for brands to create product-centric content.

They need to stay consistent with the brand\u2019s imagery across the board, leaving the local team with a limited degree of creative control.", "5. WeChat ads are just like Facebook ads", "Even though WeChat keeps reinventing its functions, the WeChat ads system is relatively basic compared to Facebook or Google.", "For example, while Facebook ads are very advanced and can drive sales, according to Chen, \u201cOn WeChat, what a brand can do is limited.\u201d \u201cThey are not able to build a complex campaign to retarget customers,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s best to use WeChat ads for follower acquisition and branding.\u201d", "Jeremy Webb, the Vice President, and Head of Social for Ogilvy & Mather, addressed WeChat directly about this in an open letter: He said: \u201c(if you) keep improving the targeting and bringing the costs down, we\u2019ll keep on spending.\u201d", "6. WeChat is a \u201cChina mainland only\u201d social media platform", "For a lot of brands, one big misconception is that WeChat is exclusive to mainland China, so they would often hand over the development and execution of their WeChat strategy to local third party agencies or an internal China team.

Traditionally, the value of a customer is defined by financial segmentation. You purchase X USD/RMB worth of items a year, you are a VIP customer. You don\u2019t, you are a regular customer. This mantra more or less worked for decades, until the digital and mobile revolution illustrated by WeChat in China (or Kakao, Line, and WhatsApp elsewhere) changed the game and the way consumers interact with one another. Closed messaging\u00ad-app platforms have surpassed public social\u00ad media platforms (Weibo, Renren, Facebook, Twitter), forcing companies to adapt themselves to a new eco\u00adsystem.", "Having said that, users in China are what we call \u201cearly adopters.\u201d They test, digest, and adopt any technological trends faster than anyone can imagine. Hence, they change their minds quickly. Brand loyalty suffers because this pool of 650 million internet users in China has different expectations when it comes to brand engagement. They have an average 250 contacts on their WeChat accounts each, interact daily with about 20 of them and follow around 10 brands or corporate accounts. They belong to between five and 10 groups where their contacts share similar interests or passions (sport, media, food, travel, fashion, etc.). They barely open their professional mailboxes anymore as they are probably filled with advertising that is not relevant to their profiles. When they receive SMS texts, 90 percent of the time they are spam from random insurance or financial\u00ad services firms. Social CRM is definitively the present and future of digital marketing. Here are three steps to build this strategy with pragmatic examples:", "1. Identify your most active customers and their social influence networks.", "Twenty percent of customers make 60 to 70 percent of a brand\u2019s revenues. As online acquisition costs are rocketing, a CRM mindset is the right strategy to \u201cfidelise\u201d your existing customer base and increase repetitive purchase. When Facebook generates 85 percent of its revenue from advertising, Tencent will make this same 85 percent with added CRM services. Once you have identified your best customers based on their daily activities (account clicks, content checked, number of chats) and campaign activities (to whom they share content, how many times), you will be able to map their social influence networks. Here comes the question: how can I recruit more customers if I rely on my existing ones? The answer is simple: by turning these influencers into brand ambassadors.", "", "2. Reward their social activities and turn them into brand ambassadors.", "Traditionally, CRM rewards only purchase amounts, which is starting to be outdated in a globalized world. We should reward passion for a brand. In other words, brands need to reward love before money. In this second phase, social influence has to be screened and integrated within a real loyalty program or membership strategy\u2014especially in China, where consumers behave on the principle of \u201cconcentric circles.\u201d Managerial\u00ad-level consumers go out with managers, directors with directors. A customer who can afford a five-star hotel suite or a brand new couture collection of clothes might have a significant part of his network who can do the same.", "", "3. Targeted communication with a digital tech mindset.", "One of the key points of social CRM is to accept a reduced frequency of \u201cpush messages.\u201d No one likes to receive daily messages on their smartphones. To brands: you don\u2019t lose anything by communicating less with your customers. There are only 24 hours per day, and the key to get the most of a messaging app like WeChat is to use it as a tailored, direct communication channel to premium customers. Based on their profiles (gender, location, subscription time, content checked), brands should send specific privileges and offers that are tailor-made for them, such as Shanghai store opening news only to Shanghai\u00ad based customers.", "", "Conclusion:", "In China, the overall market is becoming more competitive and consumers more mature. Brands and agencies have to adapt their consumer engagement techniques and find the right \u201cleash\u201d to retain customer loyalty.

Although Alibaba\u2019s massively popular online platform Taobao remains a key driver of this activity, more recently the convenience and real-time nature of mobile apps like WeChat have become more important.", "Although the size of China\u2019s daigou market continues to encourage new start-ups like Red to spring up, seeking a piece of the lucrative pie, WeChat\u2019s place in the daigou world is more natural and seamless, as the app is already a part of daily life for hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. Active sellers can essentially position themselves as overseas private shoppers for buyers back home, posting photos of in-store inventory, inquiring about sizes, and finalizing the transaction in-app via TenPay (WeChat parent company Tencent\u2019s online payment system).", "Most recently, both Alibaba\u2014via its Alipay payment system\u2014and WeChat have rolled out new features that could increase the sophistication levels of daigou agents\u2019 small businesses even more.

It\u2019s feasible that a daigou merchant with an existing buyer base on Taobao or WeChat would be able to offer products on a payment plan, giving less well-heeled buyers the chance to get that Gucci or Balenciaga bag now.", "This type of feature has the potential to drive gray market sales in new markets throughout China, and among younger consumers with less disposable income. But beyond that, advanced functionality like bill-splitting or virtual layaway means that brands will need to face an increasingly sophisticated gray market in the months and years ahead.

The answer lies in the fundamental demand of Chinese consumers: safety guaranteed. Online shopping safety is key for e-commerce development in China, and third-party payment emerged to solve this problem.", "Take Alipay, for instance. It was first developed by Alibaba to protect its Taobao consumers and mitigate their concerns about online shopping fraud, since at Taobao\u2019s early stage, poor quality products were widespread on its platform. The way Alipay works is partly similar to PayPal in the United States: after an online shopper confirms payment for an order via Alipay, the money will be held by Alipay and not transferred into the seller\u2019s account until the consumer informs Alipay to release the payment. \u00a0This method helps guarantee that a customer will only have to pay for the product when he or she has received it and feels satisfied with it.

Why Starbucks has been able to avoid a consumer backlash for its China pricing provides three key lessons for luxury brands that are trying to engage with China\u2019s increasingly global consumers:", "Chinese consumers don\u2019t like feeling ripped off", "Starbucks was a poorly chosen target for CCTV\u2019s smear campaign, for the simple reason that its China pricing is more closely aligned with global levels than nearly every premium category. While a Starbucks coffee costs roughly 25 percent more in Shanghai than in New York, premium apparel, cosmetics, and handbags are commonly 40 to 100 percent more expensive in China than abroad. Chinese consumers are aware of these large price differences* and are (understandably) unwilling to purchase domestically when they have other options. That said, in my firm\u2019s recent study of Chinese tourists Europe, consumers rarely knew actual price differences between China and Europe and price comparisons between European countries were almost nonexistent. Not wanting to be ripped off* is the primary driver of overseas purchasing behavior, rather than an attempt to find the lowest price.", "With that in mind, consumers accept in principal that foreign brands should cost slightly more in China than they do abroad, and are willing to pay a small premium for convenient access to these products. Starbucks\u2019 25 percent premium is within these tolerance levels. A nearly 100 percent premium for Kiehl\u2019s skincare products is not, and drives consumers to purchase abroad or through a shopping agent. Luxury brands, take notice.", "Consumers are willing to pay for experiences", "Starbucks is not about coffee. Starbucks is an experience\u2014and this is even more so the case in China where the local Starbucks is a key destination for business meetings, study sessions and catching up with friends. Consumers don\u2019t begrudge paying Starbucks\u2019 prices because the value they receive (a few hours in a nice, quiet location, free Wi-Fi, and the prestige of a premium venue) goes far beyond the price of a coffee. This same logic applies to luxury brands. Luxury is a category driven by emotions, and brands can negate consumers\u2019 feeling of being \u201cripped off\u201d when paying the \u201cChina price\u201d by creating unique experiences that add value beyond a simple transaction. Already, brands are being more innovative in engaging with their Chinese customers, and we expect to see more following in the footsteps of brands such as Hublot.", "There are opportunities in non-transferrable categories", "If a consumer wants a cheaper Starbucks latte, they can\u2019t order it online or have a friend bring it back from an overseas shopping trip. Likewise, there will always be luxury products or categories that are more protected than others from international pricing differentials. Domestic demand for luxury cars, despite being more than double the price in China than abroad, is not going anywhere since customers don\u2019t have alternatives to paying the China. Demand for last-minute jewelry gifts is enduring, as any boyfriend or husband will know. Made-to-measure suits, with multiple fittings, face logistical challenges for targeting the Chinese traveler and will always be more convenient to purchase at home.", "As easily transferrable purchases shift online and abroad, there are winners and losers in the domestic market at both the brand and the category level. To be maximize their success, luxury groups and brands should identify what categories are protected from this trend and optimize their portfolios and domestic presence accordingly.", "*Adding insult to injury, consumers believe the bulk of the price difference goes to the government.

What sends a luxury brand home from China with its gilded tail between its legs? \u00a0Variations on these two questions are what I have been asked most often during my years helping luxury companies build their businesses and brands in China and with global Chinese consumers.", "Ten or fifteen years ago, the answer was fairly straightforward. Be a mega-luxury brand from Europe with a long history and heritage; go to China early; capitalize on lack of competition and lack of consumer sophistication; invest heavily in people, infrastructure, and brand building; have the stomach to lose money for several years; break even; reinvest; expand; and then watch the profits grow.", "This model still has some merit, but so much has changed in China and with Chinese consumers over the last ten years that it\u2019s no longer enough to ensure success.", "The truth is that the formula for success has gotten much more complicated: by e-commerce, diversification of luxury consumer demographics, fiercer competition, the cost of doing business, and a more global Chinese luxury consumer.

Patience", "An Ermenegildo Zegna ad shot in Beijing.", "Ermenegildo Zegna was the first luxury men\u2019s brand to open a fully owned and operated menswear store in China (Beijing 1991).\u00a0 The company now has 70 stores\u00a0and China is now the largest and most profitable market in the world for the company.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t always that way. Zegna started small, endured slow sales, lost money, invested heavily in brand building and education, and most important of all in my opinion, expanded incrementally. It took 20 years to go from one store to 70.\u00a0 That is not the model all luxury brands need to follow, but the lesson is clear: learn the market, make mistakes, regroup, expand incrementally, and have the patience of a Zegna, and you are one-fourth of the way to success. With a solid foundation like Zegna\u2019s, a luxury brand can weather the ups and downs of the Chinese luxury market.", "2. Have a Great History, Compelling Story, and Authentic Heritage", "A great story can and often does start with a great visionary and founder\u2014someone who sets the tone for a company\u2019s quality and values for 100 years or more\u2014think of Coco Chanel, Enzo Ferrari, Louis Comfort Tiffany, or Mario Prada. The great luxury story can also be associated with a city or region (Swiss watches, French wines, American cosmetics), or simply the story and history of a great product.\u00a0 Chinese luxury consumers place a premium on authenticity and history, and successful luxury brands in China have genuine and interesting histories and stories to tell in one of more of these categories.", "3. Excellent Communication", "Having a noted founder, a great story, and a long history are meaningless if you cannot effectively communicate these assets to your audience and if you do not know which audiences you are communication with.", "As I point out in all of my columns, China is not a monolithic single \u201cmarket,\u201d nor are Chinese luxury consumers a heterogeneous group of buyers reading, watching, and absorbing the same media.", "Understanding the three main groups of luxury buyers in China and where and how to tell your story to them is the third thing successful luxury brands have in common. In article worth reading in its entirety for its breakdown on luxury branding in China, Labbrand breaks down these three main categories:", "Chinese luxury consumers can be generally categorized into three groups. First is the nouveau riche (ultra-rich) group who acquired their wealth over the past decades. These consumers and their families are purchasing luxury goods within mainland China and are not sensitive to the dramatic price differences. A majority of this nouveau riche group reside in 1st to 3rd tier cities. Second is the gifting group; consumers in this group are generally buying luxury goods within mainland China for gifting (mainly for business or government-related purposes). They are not sensitive to price differences because costs will be covered by their corporations. The third group, and by far the biggest in population, is the Chinese middle class consumers who are brand-conscious. These consumers are price sensitive. They often work and reside in 1st or 2nd tier cities.", "4. To Change or Not to Change? That is the Question", "Perhaps one of the most difficult balancing acts in branding and selling luxury goods in China is understanding when and if you should begin producing marketing, messaging, and products with a more distinctly Chinese look, feel, and focus, and when and if you should add lines or products in the accessible luxury categories.", "Successful luxury brands in China have a good sense of whether they should stick to their guns and continue to put their exclusivity and traditional messaging front and center and to not alter their product lines for a Chinese demographic at all.

That\u2019s unusual in the real estate industry, and means that professionals and marketers need to work much harder to establish networks of potential buyers.", "In terms of competencies and skills, Brown added, \u201cmost of the failed transactions we see involving buyers from China can be attributed to a real estate agent who does not understand how to effectively engage buyers from China, either culturally or professionally.\u201d Many best practices can be acquired only through years of experience, and brand professionals in all industries need to take time to learn and adapt their skillsets to serve an international and Asian clientele.", "Luxury brand professionals need to adapt practices to serve these affluent new arrivals.", "Most importantly, brands should recognize that not all Chinese customers are alike, and should take the time to understand customer profiles, preferences, and habits.

You may be surprised at the level of brand awareness that your brand does or does not have in China.

For most luxury and fashion companies, the answer to this question is no. Although there are some very interesting new boutiques in Beijing and Shanghai, in China the large majority of branded apparel, footwear, accessories, and hard luxury goods are sold via single-brand stores, even within the department store environment (with the exception of Lane Crawford, which itself still has a relatively limited footprint in China).\u00a0", "Do you have the merchandise range for a single-brand store? Given the predominance of single-brand stores in China, it is imperative for a brand to have a merchandise assortment with enough depth and breadth to support an entire store. For brands that are largely wholesalers in other markets, this can be a challenge; even brands that have a China retail partner need to think like a retailer, not like a wholesaler.", "Are you ready to invest significant money or time and resources into the China market? \u00a0There are many different ways in which to enter the China market: wholly owned retail, licensing, national distribution agreements, investment partnerships, regional distribution, wholly owned e-commerce, e-commerce distribution agreements, and arms-length wholesale deals. While each of these arrangements entail varying levels of financial investment, all of them will require the investment of management time and resources, ranging from product localization to retail design to visual merchandising, brand support, and more. Entry to China is a long-term commitment, and should be treated as such by brand management.", "If you answered yes to all of these questions, then your brand might be ready to start the process of entering the market in some form. If you are embarking upon this road, the best advice is to start early. Brands find that it typically takes them at least three years from the decision to enter the market until they start selling at a decent level of volume in China. Finding the right partner is the most important part of the equation, and it takes time\u2013especially if you want to avoid costly and brand-crippling mistakes that many others have made by choosing the wrong partner. Securing your first retail location is no picnic in China\u2019s hyper-competitive retail landscape, and once you open your first store, there will inevitably be several rounds of tweaks to get the concept, pricing, merchandising, and service level right for the market.", "If, on the other hand, you answered no to some of these questions, it\u2019s probably best to spend more time evaluating the market in the context of your brand and situation. Make some trips to China, meet the right industry insiders, do a brand audit, discuss your brand and product proposition with consumers and retail professionals, and most importantly, take your company\u2019s temperature on its appetite for the long and inevitably bumpy road ahead.", "As for the question about whether you can simply target Chinese tourists\u2013this one is complex too. It is no secret that the brands that are reaping the largest rewards from Chinese tourists are the same ones who have been investing in the mainland market for years to develop their brand image and customer following there. However, there are some instances of brands and retailers who are seeing success not just with Chinese tourists but with e-commerce purchases coming from the mainland or friends who are ordering online and hand-carrying products back to China. Notably, Victoria\u2019s Secret has no mainland China presence, but consistently ranks high among Chinese tourists when visiting the United States. Other brands and retailers have seen success with this demographic, but typically it takes an investment in marketing your brand and actively engaging Chinese tourists or consumers in creative, below-the-line activities and brand building.", "Financially speaking, the numbers coming out of China are often staggering, and for brands that get China right, entering the market is a game changer. However, brand management should not underestimate the time, investment, and accompanying headaches needed to get the market right.

Along with Patrick Tam and Frances Lam\u2019s Knockbox Coffee Company,\u00a0Espresso Alchemy, and Barista Jam, Rabbithole\u00a0is one of a new breed of serious coffee spots that have cropped up in Hong Kong over the last five years.

We had a lot of people asking a lot of questions, let me put it that way. But now, people are starting to like it quite a lot \u2014 no more syrup, no more loading it up with sugar, actually tasting the coffee. Also, it\u2019s not just Hong Kong [locals], we have many expats \u2014 a lot of Europeans, a lot of Australians and Kiwis \u2014 giving us a lot of support.

A lot of times when people go to a caf\u00e9, they just order it and sit at the table. We don\u2019t do that. When people come in, we try to explain what they are drinking, what are the components, what beans they\u2019re choosing, and how it tastes. We explain a lot so they have an idea of all these things.

Is it just about convenience? Do you see it growing in popularity in the near future?", "M: Instant coffee basically means they want it fast. They want the caffeine to chuck in their mouth. That\u2019s what they ultimately want. Slow-brewed coffee means, in other words, we take it slow. We actually want to get the flavor out of the beans, not just the caffeine. It takes a little bit of skill, but a lot of people can have easy access to the right equipment. Yet a lot of them \u2014 because they\u2019re not using fresh coffee and don\u2019t know how to do it \u2014 often say, \u201cHow come I slow-brew coffee and it still sucks?\u201d It\u2019s just because they haven\u2019t been properly shown how to do it.

It takes some practice, but you can definitely do it at home as long as you have delicious coffee. We\u2019re talking about very precise things, like coffee grind size, how to brew the coffee, what temperature water to use to make a better cup of coffee. We\u2019re no longer talking about instant coffee. ", "When people first start drinking slow-brewed coffee, the first thing that often hits them is the character of the beans. A lot of African beans or South American beans taste very fruity or acidic. First, they need to break through that acidic taste. The first time, they don\u2019t like it. Then, the second or third time, they say, \u201cOh, wow\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of things going on in the beans, and they slowly start to enjoy it. A lot of people, like myself, will start with a mocha because it has chocolate in it. Then, we\u2019ll move to a latt\u00e9, then to a lower quantity of milk, then move to espresso. But, then even after an espresso, we think it\u2019s too bold. There\u2019s just too much going on. So we make it even simpler. Then we\u2019ll do a slow-brew. Simple, break it down. Then we\u2019ll just enjoy it like you would wine or whiskey. I don\u2019t expect people who love their latt\u00e9s to start hating them and pick up slow-brew instantly.

What kind of relationships is Rabbithole trying to build, and how are you building them?", "M: Well, at the beginning, the idea for Rabbithole was to be a place where people can share. What we have is literally one communal table, surrounded by all the coffee machines and tools. So when we\u2019re doing a slow brew, we\u2019re doing it right in front of customers. We try to explain how it works, and they can ask questions like, \u201cWhy are you doing that? What temperature are you using? How come you do this?\u201d We\u2019re not saying that it\u2019s the only way to do it \u2014 there are a thousand ways to do it. But at least we open up the conversation among the customers. Because of the small communal table, they start to talk to each other, and they start to talk about coffee. This is exactly what I want. They are educating and sharing with each other. Coffee should be something fun. A lot of coffee people or baristas are quite cocky. I don\u2019t like that at all. Good coffee shouldn\u2019t be a secret to hide away, it should be something to share.", "JD: What role does social media play in your outreach?", "M: Social media plays a huge part in our company. Since we\u2019re small, we don\u2019t have the money to go on TV or in magazines. And, seriously, those kinds of ads won\u2019t work. Coffee is a lifestyle thing. Peer sharing or word-of-mouth is more powerful than paid advertising. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t do paid advertising at all. ", "At the beginning, we just want to do our coffee right, get our basics right. When people start enjoying it, they\u2019ll start socializing and then we\u2019ll use Twitter or Facebook to share what we know. We share how we make the coffee and news about coffee. We actually talk to people around the world \u2014 from London, from Australia, from the US. Of course, we\u2019re still mostly based in Hong Kong, but that\u2019s how the conversation starts. I don\u2019t think we have done enough yet in social media, but it definitely has the potential to help us build our brand and our product. Although a lot of people live in Hong Kong, those who actually drink coffee are part of a pretty small crowd.

Janice [Leung, Island East Markets co-organizer] did talk to me about it earlier, but we were a bit too late. But next time we\u2019d love to join in. What Island East Markets is doing is brilliant because they bring the freshest produce and small businesses together in one place, under one roof.

They do their own thing well, they do their farming well, but they don\u2019t have a place to channel their efforts. They don\u2019t know about Sunday markets. Of course, Hong Kong is a small place, so how can you get a Sunday market going? In New York, you can use a park, but in Hong Kong even if you use a park, the local government will ask you, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Which is why Janice is so important to this food revolution.

This is really important to the community, not only to the farmers, but to end users like me.", "Facing the Mid-Levels escalators", "JD: How has your experience with opening Rabbithole changed your life?", "M: It has changed my life completely. I used to be an office worker in media. I\u2019d been doing media advertising for five or six years. Because of coffee, I quit my job, went back to Australia, and worked in a caf\u00e9. I came back and started something that I really like, not just another caf\u00e9, but something different.

The awareness of\u00a0how this produce is being farmed, however, is low. Some farmers may be\u00a0using traditional, sustainable crop-rotation methods, while others might be\u00a0using\u00a0fertilizers\u00a0and pesticides heavily. Consumers don\u2019t think about these\u00a0enough. Around 99 percent of food in Hong Kong is imported, a lot of it from\u00a0mainland China. With the number of food safety scandals in recent years,\u00a0awareness of provenance has been raised to an extent. The relationship\u00a0between produce and one\u2019s body is better understood than the relationship\u00a0between produce and the environment.

Here are a few of the \u201cbig misses\u201d we noticed:", "1.) The article focuses its chief criticism on Poly yet lumps together all Chinese auction houses", "Though Beijing Poly \u2014 part of the massive state-owned China Poly Group \u2014 is the largest player in the domestic Chinese auction market, it is not the only player. In an article that looks to expose shady practices by Poly, it seems misguided to drag other mainland auction houses like China Guardian into the mix because: A.) Poly and Guardian are direct competitors with distinct business aims, and B.)\u00a0five of the top 10 auction houses in the world are now Chinese. Poly is big, but it is not the entirety of the massive Chinese art market. Going after Poly, with backed-up research and statistics, is one thing. Tossing others into the same pot without similar attribution is another altogether.", "2.) The article couples the\u00a0Hong Kong and mainland China auction markets together", "Another major distinction that this article did not make is that of adequately separating the mainland China and Hong Kong art markets. That mainland Chinese auction houses \u2014 which are far younger than their counterparts in the West \u2014 are less thorough with authentication, and have issues with non-payment and bidders inflating prices, is not news to anybody who has followed the Asian art market for any length of time. But to lump together the issues surrounding auction houses like Beijing Poly \u2014 the main focus of the article \u2014 with the activities of, say, Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, which are unable to operate in mainland China and conduct their China business through Hong Kong, simply doesn\u2019t reflect the reality of the situation.", "3.) The article never addresses the headline figure of $13 billion\u00a0", "A flashy and compelling headline is never substantiated with corresponding numbers in the article.", "4.) Beijing Poly is not the only large-scale Asian company with ties to both art and the defense industry", "Again, going after Poly is fair game. But to think it\u2019s the only arm of a massive conglomerate with ties to weapons-making and the defense industry is a bit short-sighted. In addition to their more readily identifiable industries, Samsung and Mitsubishi among others too are involved in weapons-making. Like Poly, Samsung is also heavily involved in the arts, with its Samsung Museum of Art and Samsung Foundation.", "Mainland Chinese collectors now dominate the market for Chinese traditional art and antiques", "5.) The article fails to examine \u201cChinese art\u201d as what it really is: many discrete segments", "One core criticism raised by the article about Poly (and, by extension, the whole Chinese art market) is that works purchased by bidders there can be used for bribery. This is not a new argument, yet is one that has been raised many times before, specifically about the traditional ink-and-paper auction market in China. However, the article fails to distinguish between art segments and note that the problems plaguing, say, auction houses in mainland China do not necessarily have an impact on similar segments in more regulated markets like Hong Kong or New York \u2014 where a great deal of these works still go under the hammer.", "6.) The link between the criticism of Poly and the ultimate impact on global collectors is weak", "The ultimate aim of the article is to convince readers that there is a massive global impact on pricing due to market manipulation and other unsavory actions by Beijing Poly. However, this presupposes that buyers outside of China are continuing to collect Chinese art segments like traditional ink-and-paper paintings, calligraphy and antiques \u2014 segments in which Poly is heavily involved. However, in these segments Western collectors are more likely to be seen selling to Poly rather than buying from them.

Digital communities are a powerful way to make people feel special. In the long run such a community can also help better segment and service a brand\u2019s buyers based on their interests.

According to Beijing-based branding exec Faith Brewitt, getting a better sense of this generation\u2019s motivations and aspirations is no small task.

Hire Local, They\u2019re Thinking Global", "Not only are professional Chinese women highly educated, they\u2019re globally minded and born networkers. As Brewitt points out, \u201cA very real phenomenon in China today is young women collecting MBAs, not only for the international business knowledge and insights, but also to grow their professional and personal networks.\u201d", "2.) Millennials Really Are Alike", "Going counter to the stereotype that young Chinese are an insular, inscrutable demographic of group-thinkers, Brewitt holds that \u201cChinese Millennials are like all Millennials the world over.\u201d Like their counterparts in North America and Europe, young professional women in China with whom Brewitt spoke made it clear that they hope to work for companies with values that extend past simple profit, and believe they \u201cdeserve top dollar when it comes to salaries.\u201d Though much has been made of the difficulty of maintaining Chinese talent, and this group\u2019s proclivity to jump from company to company at a moment\u2019s notice, Brewitt notes that this \u201cis really a reflection of their discontent with companies that just don\u2019t get them.\u201d The lesson to be taken here, then, is for companies to \u201chire today\u2019s young top talent now, invest in them and you\u2019ll keep them around.\u201d", "3.)

Said Wen in the report, \u201cExpanding domestic consumption, especially consumer demand, is the key to China maintaining stable and rapid economic growth, and is this year\u2019s priority.\u201d In response to the report, Liu Kegu, a former official on fiscal and tax reform at the Ministry of Finance, said Chinese government ministries \u201cmust get ready for the [luxury tax reduction].\u201d", "Rumors of a luxury tax cut in China set off a storm of speculation throughout the week, and sent shares for Prada and Burberry \u2014 brands with huge presence in the country \u2014 soaring.", "The only problem with reading too much into the rumors is that we\u2019ve heard them before.", "Chinese tourists will likely continue buying luxury goods overseas for some time", "One year ago, at the 2011 National People\u2019s Congress (\u4e24\u4f1a), Dalian Wanda Group chairman Wang Jianlin (\u738b\u5efa\u6797) and others called out to the Chinese government to reduce import duties, saying high luxury taxes inhibit job growth and decrease tax revenue, as \u201cChinese people sit on airplanes to deliver jobs and tax money to foreign countries.\u201d In the months that followed, signs indicated that Beijing was listening to growing calls to abolish or lower its luxury tax code. By June, Ministry of Commerce spokesman Yao Jian sought to inject himself into the debate, saying, \u201cthe direction [the government] will take is to further reduce import tariffs on middle- and high-end products.\u201d", "By October, though, little had been done. Instead of moving quickly to cut luxury taxes, bureaucrats in Beijing had busied themselves trying to pin down the exact meaning of the word \u201cluxury.\u201d As Lu Peijun, deputy head of the General Administration of Customs, told China Daily at the time, \u201cTariff cuts are an issue of the top priority with policymakers. However, the definition of luxury products should be made more accurate to better delineate tariff policies.\u201d Along with semantic roadblocks, another reason given by analysts for Beijing\u2019s slow moves was infighting between the Ministries of Finance and Commerce on what should be done. While the Ministry of Commerce strongly supports tariff cuts to spur more Chinese consumers to shop domestically, China Daily notes that the Ministry of Finance opposes the cuts. And in typically opaque fashion, Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said in October that \u201cit\u2019s unclear whether the two ministries have reached a consensus.\u201d", "By the end of 2011, after months of wrangling, the only progress seen on the luxury tax reduction was a vague assurance by Beijing that import taxes would be reduced for 730 consumer products, including high-end cosmetics, cigarettes and liquor. However, as Jing Daily pointed out last month, these moves have had little effect, as price increases of anywhere from 5-15 percent by the brands themselves have outpaced tax reductions (which averaged a weak 4.4 percent).", "Though we\u2019ll wait to see whether Beijing enacts another round of more comprehensive tax reforms for the luxury sector, we\u2019re skeptical that any further moves will spur domestic consumption in any significant way. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, the luxury tax in China is just one tariff among many that is tacked on to imported goods. If that luxury import tax is slashed, consumers in China still need to contend with a stiff consumption tax and VAT, not to mention regular price increases by brands.", "Tweet", "Follow @JingDaily ", "", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", "", "  "]}, {"title": "National Theatres Of China & Scotland On Collaborative Hunt For New Work", "meta": "March 8, 2012", "paragraphs": ["A special tartan was created this January to welcome two giant pandas to the Edinburgh Zoo", "Scotland\u2019s deepening ties with China are going beyond simply supplying Scotch, cashmere and the game of golf to the latter\u2019s emerging high-end consumer class (and receiving two giant pandas in return).

With China\u2019s outbound tourism market surging, and Chinese nationals expected to take 100 million trips abroad by 2015, Thai tourism officials expect this group to soon become the largest source market for outbound tourists to Thailand, surpassing Malaysia, and likely dominate for years to come, if not permanently.", "In an attempt to keep this momentum going, the Tourism of Authority of Thailand (TAT) has a series of marketing events and activities planned for 2012, including even more relaxed visa regulations and new ad campaigns.

Though outbound Chinese tourists in Thailand are still broadly visiting as part of tour groups, increasing independent travel and higher spending on accommodations by second- or third-time visitors and younger travelers is giving developers cause for optimism.

As Shaun Rein of the China Market Research Group recently wrote of a conversation with a Thai luxury hotelier:", "The Chinese, he said, want lively, louder environments where they can shop for Louis Vuitton and Gucci bags and eat in large groups, while European visitors prefer a more tranquil, quiet, back-to-nature kind of experience. \u201cWhen too many Chinese, Indians, and Russians come and we cater to them by opening shopping centers or set up large group tables, we see a clash with what the Europeans want.

In the wake of this latest price increase, many consumers have expressed confusion. \u201cWhy is it that even after taxes were lowered, cosmetic prices have shot up?\u201d said one, while another exclaimed, \u201cWhen are domestic brands going to be able to end foreign brands\u2019 power to set prices?\u201d", "At the end of 2011, after several rounds of discussions between the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration of Taxation, China\u2019s \u201cluxury\u201d cosmetics and skincare category had import tariffs reduced from 10 percent to 4.4 percent, but the luxury tax duty and VAT were kept the same.", "Industry experts estimate that the tax cuts might not be enough to significantly lower prices.

Though American and Australian winemakers are increasing their efforts both on the ground in China and online in order to better position themselves to compete with their French rivals, the competitive advantage of French wines in terms of reputation in the young Chinese market have kept them far ahead in import volume and sales.

With mainland Chinese outbound tourism surging over 20 percent in 2011, and Chinese tourist-shoppers flocking to places like Hong Kong, New York and Paris to leave millions with high-end retailers while soaking up culture, luring mainlanders to Macau via a diverse range of offerings has taken on new urgency. Last month, in the hopes of boosting his city\u2019s cultural profile, local media mogul Ricardo Pinto launched the inaugural Script Road Literary Festival, an event geared towards plugging Macau\u2019s rich artistic and cultural history, which Pinto admitted is typically overshadowed by the city\u2019s massive gaming market. (Which surpassed Las Vegas to become the world\u2019s largest back in 2006.) Though the city has struggled to attract luxury brands on the scale of Hong Kong, Macau is slowly gaining a reputation among mainland Chinese consumers as a shopping, as well as gambling, haven, with the former Portuguese colony sharing space with the former British colony in the first-ever Louis Vuitton Hong Kong/Macau City Guide, released late last year.", "Though media figures, tourism authorities, luxury retailers and local celebrities continue to work together to promote Macau as more than a gambler\u2019s paradise, perhaps no one has been as high-profile in his efforts to remake the city as an entertainment\u00a0destination\u00a0as Steve Wynn. Working tirelessly to rebrand the city, as he once did in Las Vegas, in recent years Wynn has sought to make his name synonymous with culture and the arts \u2014 as well as gambling \u2014 in Macau. Last year, Wynn engaged in one of his most high-profile PR moves in the city, unveiling a set of Qing Dynasty vases he purchased at auction in London for \u00a38 million (US$12.8 million).

As Forbes notes, the city has become increasingly critical for figures like Wynn and his global rival Sheldon Adelson. Last year, Wynn Resorts made 72 percent of its US$5.2 billion in revenue from Macau, while Adelson\u2019s Las Vegas Sands made a whopping 82 percent of its $9.4 billion revenue from Asia in the same period. Between the two, Adelson and Wynn have invested a staggering $15 billion in Asia over the past decade, and neither wants to fall behind given the growing presence of mainland Chinese high-rollers in gambling enclaves like Singapore and Macau.", "Via Forbes:", "Unlike Adelson, Wynn is going after the higher-income Chinese who invest in art\u2013and love high-stakes gambling with a fervor. Thanks in part to his detailed attention to luxury and pampering service, Wynn derives 80% of his business from Macao\u2019s so-called VIP gamblers (the overall rate is 70%). According to Jake Fuller of Lazard Capital, Wynn\u2019s casino produces profit at a rate of $6,943 per table each day compared with $3,856 at the Adelson properties. ", "Despite the massive investments they\u2019ve made in Macau, the article points out that both Adelson and Wynn have their eyes on a much larger, but still unattainable goal: opening sprawling resorts in mainland China. This desire goes a long way in explaining why both men have gone to great pains to foster good relations with Beijing:", "Right now, in all of China, it\u2019s legal to gamble only in Macao, 11 square miles of densely packed humanity. It\u2019s not even legal to collect a gambling debt on the mainland. But most observers expect that the Chinese gov\u00adern\u00adment, recognizing Macao\u2019s logistical \u00adlim\u00adi\u00adta\u00adtions and drawn to the twin lures of \u00adde\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment and taxes, will inevitably bring gambling onto the mainland.", "Thus Adelson and Wynn must perpetually scramble to stay on the government\u2019s good side. Adelson is credited with helping smooth over China\u2019s 2008 Olympics bid with American skeptics. For Wynn\u2019s part, he\u2019s been studying Mandarin and has pledged $135 million to the University of Macau, which sits on Chinese-owned land\u2026Four years before he bought the Qing vases, Wynn spent $10 million on a 650-year-old red vase from the Hongwu period, which he promptly donated to the Macao government\u2019s cultural affairs bureau.

Were you always passionate about jazz? ", "Zhang Le (ZL): I was a studio musician before I started to sing jazz. Before that, I was in one of the best local children\u2019s choirs for seven years, singing only classical music. However, I was really into pop music when I was younger. In 2000, I was offered a singing gig at the Hilton Shanghai, and the hotel wanted to hear jazz standards, so that\u2019s why I came to learn jazz.", "JD: Tell us a little about your album [\u201cWhen Will the Moon Be Clear and Bright\u201c]. ", "ZL: This album is the one that reflects who I am as a musician and singer. Most the songs are original music with Chinese lyrics, and the idea came from old poems, Buddhist Sutras, and personal experience. Some of my favorite pieces [derive] from 1930s Shanghai movie songs. I rearranged all of the music, and gave them a different flavor. I am deeply influenced by jazz, and I am also familiar with Chinese folk melodies as well as the language, so the combination of the two turned out to be something personal, or so-called Chinese-American fusion jazz. ", "JD: Apart from fusing elements from Chinese folk music and opera in your album, the album includes two Buddhism-influenced songs. What were you trying to convey with this? ", "ZL: Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion to me.  These two songs were composed by bassist Russ Flynn, and they are powerful and emotional. By the time [I recorded them], I was reading the Heart Sutra, and was going through a difficult period, and I was trying to find peace with myself. So I put some lines from the Sutra to Russ\u2019s music, and it worked. These songs reflect a specific moment in my life, when I wanted to share my feelings with others. ", "JD: There are a lot of Chinese elements in your music. Have you encountered any difficulties in communicating about your music with other musicians in the United States? ", "ZL: No, all the musicians I work with are very professional, and as I said, I am deeply influenced by jazz, so we\u2019re all speaking the same language musically. They love pentatonic melodies, and have been really impressed by the melodic variation. Still, it\u2019s been lot of fun to explain the meaning of the lyrics to [American] musicians, because sometimes they can\u2019t understand the \u201cChinese way of thinking,\u201d and that\u2019s just a cultural difference.

I am enjoying sharing my music with them.", "JD: How do the jazz scenes differ between New York and Shanghai? ", "ZL: New York is very competitive, and it can be very difficult to make a living as an independent artist. I am very lucky, because right now China is a hot-spot, and many people are interested in our culture. So it really brings in a lot of opportunities. Shanghai has a great jazz scene right now. I was there for the International Jazz Festival in October, and it was a wonderful experience.

What do you think is the future of jazz in China? ", "ZL: Shanghai was called the \u201cParis of the East\u201d in the 1930s, and if you listen to the old songs from that era, you can understand the popularity of jazz in China. I was singing at the Hilton Shanghai back in 2000, and before I left for Boston in 2004, Shanghai had already become quite well known for its jazz scene in Asia. However, things are getting even better now. We have the Shanghai International Jazz Festival every year, and that attracts so many great musicians from all over the world.

For example, the estimate for two magnums of Richebourg 1985 is HK $500,000 to HK $700,000. Let\u2019s say the auction hammer falls at HK $600,000 \u2013 that will make those two magnums worth US $46,000 including buyer\u2019s premium. Even a case of Vosne-Roman\u00e9e 1995 is estimated between HK $150,000 to HK $200,000. And this is only a village wine! Even if it sold at the low estimate, that makes it US $2,000 a bottle! Same price as Richebourg 1995 from the Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti! It is insane\u2026or is it?", "Okay. To be fair, the wines have the best provenance possible. They come straight from the Jayer family\u2019s cellars and they are in immaculate condition. They have never been moved from their home. And as a bonus, they are all packed in original wooden cases. This is rather special, as wines from Henri Jayer were always packed in paper cartons rather than wood. There are only two exceptions: one is the wines released now and previously from the family cellar; and the other is wines that were bought on release by the world famous restaurant Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence.", "If prices for lots at the Jayer auction do indeed reach the \u201cstratospheric highs\u201d Bohrer foresees, we can safely say that two factors \u2014 provenance and region \u2014 will be the main drivers. Collectors,\u00a0particularly\u00a0those from mainland China (where wine counterfeiting is endemic) have consistently gone far beyond high estimates for wine lots with excellent provenance. Last November, one such buyer, Shenzhen-based media businessman Dong Guo, purchased nearly every lot at a Cornette de Saint Cyr auction of wines from the collection of the French film and stage actor Alain Delon.

Noting that both Chinese and international brands have had to change their long-standing policy of dumping low-end inventory on the mainland China market, the article holds that more discriminating shoppers have brought about a sea-change in the country\u2019s luxury market, which has long been plagued by a flood of counterfeits. According to a recent survey by the fashion brand Escada, Chinese consumer willingness to buy fakes has plummeted in recent years, from 31 percent in 2008 to only 12 percent in 2010. Quoting Max Magni, head of McKinsey\u2019s Chinese consumer goods practice in Shanghai, the FT adds that the market for luxury fakes is growing at a snail\u2019s pace compared to the authentic market, and companies are finding that Chinese consumers are simply getting harder to please.", "This shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise to anyone who has kept an eye on the market\u2019s fundamental development over the past few years. Nor is growing brand-savviness and sophistication the only factor making it necessary for luxury brands to try harder in the China market. High import and luxury taxes \u2014 which add upwards of 40 percent to the price of luxury goods in mainland China \u2014 necessitate higher prices for individual items, as do stratospheric rents, and as such brands can\u2019t simply stock unpopular leftovers that won\u2019t sell. But with China becoming such an important part of the global luxury market this year, as European consumption may slow this year, it pays to consider which luxury brands will benefit from a more brand-savvy, quality-minded Chinese consumer in 2012.", "Though, as the FT article points out, \u201cChinese shoppers still like an extra dose of bling on everything,\u201d a trend that we expect to see continuing to spread from top-tier to second- and third-tier cities is \u201clogo-less\u201d or less conspicuous luxury. As Jing Daily wrote of this trend in December:", "This progression is perhaps natural, and not terribly surprising, since lower-key luxury has been the name of the game in developed markets like Europe and North America since the financial crisis of 2008. Some of China\u2019s more sophisticated shoppers have gone this direction anyway, in response to the growing ubiquity of Louis Vuitton and Gucci over the past several years. As Richemont Group CEO Geoffroy de la Bourdonnaye said this February, many of China\u2019s wealthier consumers are \u201cnow looking for the brands that are not necessarily on the top of the radar screen.\u201d Look for the wealthiest Chinese consumers to turn to less visible, but still very much luxurious, brands in 2012 for this very reason.", "Maison Martin Margiela boutique, Beijing (Photo: Jonathan Leijonhufvud)", "For clues about which brands may benefit this year, it\u2019s generally best to look at what\u2019s happening in top-tier cities, since what happens there tends to spread inland after a few years. While second-tier cities like Nanning celebrate their first Louis Vuitton store, Beijing has recently welcomed brands like Alexander McQueen, Maison Martin Margiela, Marni and Lanvin, and will soon get its own Alexander Wang and Sergio Rossi boutiques. Less well-known (or counterfeited) in mainland China, but popular elsewhere in Asia as well as Europe and North America, these brands should see encouraging growth rates in China in the year ahead. Already, we\u2019re seeing signs that top-tier consumers are losing some interest in rushing to Hong Kong to wait in line and fight with other tourist-shoppers for inventory that is often sold out. However, wealthy Chinese tourist-shoppers weary of major luxury brands have increasingly turned to a select few high-end multi-brand retailers like Lane Crawford and Joyce in Hong Kong, which stock a better-curated range of\u00a0prestige brands, and have stuck with these brands when they return home.", "For this reason, despite higher prices in cities like Beijing or Shanghai in comparison to Hong Kong (or New York, or Paris), in 2012 and 2013 we expect to see these top-tier urban shoppers display a greater interest in (and demand for) logo-light but high-priced brands like C\u00e9line,\u00a0Valextra, Delvaux, Chlo\u00e9\u00a0and Proenza Schouler.

Owners of luxury watchmakers Omega and Breguet, as well as the flagship Swatch, the group recorded income of 1.27 billion Swiss francs (US$1.4 billion) last year, up from 1.07 billion francs ($1.16 billion) in 2010. Rising demand in the Greater China region has been a key factor in the sales growth seen among Swiss watchmakers, with the region consuming more than half of all Swiss watch exports in 2011, which climbed 19 percent to a record 19.3 billion francs (US$20.9 billion).", "Though some luxury retailers worry that a regional slowdown in luxury consumption may take hold this year amid a tougher economic backdrop, the Swatch Group expects growth to continue throughout the year, though the company admits that the year will be more difficult due to \u201cthe high benchmark\u201d set in 2011. Rather than holding back this year in high-demand markets like China, however, we might see the Swatch Group and other watch-heavy luxury groups like LVMH and Richemont continue to expand there.

In record time, both auction houses have dominated the Chinese contemporary and traditional art segments, with China Guardian taking in US$606 million at its autumn auctions in Beijing last November alone.", "International auction houses like Christie\u2019s have benefited from the emergence of Chinese collectors on the scene in recent years, with the London-based company recording record sales of US$5.7 billion in 2011, helped by a 13 percent rise in the Asian art segment, which totaled $874.4 million. As Bloomberg pointed out last month, China\u2019s growing clout in the global art market has become starkly apparent in recent years, with the country accounting for 39 percent of the approximately $11 billion total world revenue for fine art in 2011, up from 33 percent in 2010 and ahead of the US, which accounted for 25 percent.", "For their part, Chinese collectors have shown a willingness to go far above pre-sale estimates for particularly important or desirable pieces of art. Last year, owing to frenzied buying by China\u2019s new generation of art collectors and investors, three Chinese artists were among the world\u2019s top five in terms of sales volume. Unseating long-time leader Pablo Picasso, in 2011 the Chinese artist Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) was the top auction earner of the year, with Zhang\u2019s works pulling in a total of US$506.7 million. Coming in at second and handily beating third-ranked Andy Warhol, works by another Chinese artist, Qi Baishi (1864-1957) made a combined $445.1 million, and Xu Beihong (1895-1953) paintings sold for a total of $212.9 million. Altogether, works by these three artists \u2014 who are rarely collected by Western buyers \u2014 sold for $1.16 billion. Aside from modernist artwork, Chinese buyers have pushed the boundaries of pricing in the contemporary art market as well, leading prices for the best works by top Chinese contemporary artists to pre-global economic crisis levels.", "A Zhang Daqian paining is a major status symbol among ultra-wealthy Chinese", "As Jing Daily recently noted, the fundamental motivations of Chinese collectors are an instrumental factor in the relative strength of the Chinese art market, compared to Europe or the US:", "The most pronounced trend recently taking shape among Chinese collectors \u2014 both new and established \u2014 is bidding for the best works by blue-chip Chinese contemporary artists, while remaining cool towards sub-par works. Much of this comes down to the buying priorities of Chinese collectors. Though many see collecting as a form of cultural preservation and others see it as a means to eventually opening private museums, others view collecting as a highly pragmatic activity, a bulwark against inflation, diminishing returns from cash holdings, and uncertain real estate and stock markets. As such, Chinese buyers will continue to make up an important contingent at auctions in Hong Kong, Paris, London and elsewhere as long as there is top-quality Chinese art (whether traditional or contemporary) up for grabs \u2014 regardless of the global economic climate.", "As we see from the example of Qatar\u2019s $250 million C\u00e9zanne\u00a0purchase, the boundaries of how high a work of art can sell for are becoming arbitrary. If a work by C\u00e9zanne\u00a0can sell for this much, there\u2019s no reason Chinese buyers \u2014 itching to diversify away from cash holdings amid rising inflation and low interest rates and establish themselves as credible art collectors \u2014 won\u2019t bid over $100 million for a piece of Chinese art.", "In only a few short years, the particular motivations and highly pragmatic bidding habits of Chinese collectors have reshaped the market, with artists sometimes unknown outside of China selling for millions on a consistent basis. Last year, works by Huang Binhong (1865-1955) sold for a combined total of US$86.79 million, more than double his 2010 total of $41.8 million, the renowned artist Zao Wou-Ki nearly doubling his 2010 total with sales of $90 million, and works by Wu Guanzhong (1919-2010) making a whopping $212.62 million, over 2010 revenue of $72.77 million.

Looking to cash in on the country\u2019s expanding market and sidestep film quotas, we\u2019ve seen several co-production companies form in recent years, both from the US as well as Australia.

The number of visitors to Japan fell 28% to 6.21 million last year, the lowest level since 2003, due to the nuclear accident and the sharp increase in the value of the yen against the U.S. dollar and other currencies, making Japan an increasingly expensive place to travel.

Directed by the American filmmaker Zoe Cassavetes, who has previously worked with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Miu Miu, Drum notes today that Love developed the concept, wrote the script and provided the creative direction for the 60 and 30-second \u201cTrue Rarity\u201d commercials.", "Along with shots of the Shanghai skyline, the ads feature a rare white tiger prowling the streets of the (mostly emptied, to unsettling effect) urban metropolis, which is meant to symbolize the fact that Johnnie Walker selects only one out of every 10,000 casks for its Blue Label whisky. As Love\u2019s Mike Hughes, creative lead on the campaign, said this week, the ads were part of Johnnie Walker\u2019s broader strategy to tap China\u2019s wealthy luxury consumers. Said Hughes, \u201cWe wanted to create an emotionally engaging film that would position Johnnie Walker Blue Label as a luxury brand.\u201d", "Commercials", "Brands Boost Digital Budgets To Sidestep Beijing\u2019s TV Commercial Ban", "With the Chinese government\u2019s ban on television advertisements during drama programs taking effect this month, one of the major trends we\u2019re keeping an eye on is brands shifting resources from TV to the digital space. (A move that\u2019s gained momentum in China over the past couple of years regardless of Beijing regulations.) The transition from print to television to online to mobile in China has been one of the fastest in the world, and advertisers have been quick to follow suit, rushing to keep pace with consumer preferences. This week, perhaps in an attempt to stay ahead of domestic competitors like Tsingtao and Snow, the 112-year-old, Anheuser-Busch-owned Harbin Brewery \u2014 China\u2019s oldest and fourth largest brewery \u2014 signed the London-based company Telemetry to serve and audit its online video advertising in China.", "According to iResearch, the ban on television advertising during dramas will only speed up an unmistakable trend in China\u2019s advertising market, which has seen the online video advertising market report 200 percent year-on-year growth.", "Gucci", "Chinese Pawnshops Set To Benefit After Luxury Gift-Giving Glut", "Now that Chinese New Year gift-giving season has hit its stride, major luxury brands have likely been left smiling as wealthy gift-givers loaded up on watches, wine and jewelry. But another beneficiary that stands to profit from the Chinese New Year luxury spending spree is the humble pawnshop, thousands of which have popped up throughout China in the last decade. As the Economic Observer recently noted in its profile of China\u2019s \u201cgift economy,\u201d luxury consumption with the intention of gift-giving is part and parcel of the country\u2019s holiday celebrations, and has in many ways shaped the Chinese luxury market as a whole since the first stirrings of market economy reforms in the late 1970s. As the article points out, \u201cGifts have always been the most effective lubricant in human interaction [in China]. In both urban and rural settings, a gift is a means of developing one\u2019s power and profiting in return.

Special events like an Empire State Building lighting ceremony and private performance by Lang Lang at the Montblanc flagship gave attendees the chance to take part in rare experiences closed off to most tourists. Though attendance by first-time travelers from mainland China was perhaps lower than expected, due to visa hangups or the importance of spending Chinese New Year at home with family, the week served to demystify the much discussed emergence of China\u2019s experience-focused international tourists.", "As Chris Noble, President of Affinity China, told Jing Daily, the educational aspect of Dragon Week was possibly its greatest value, both to the companies who took part and the attendees. Said Noble, \u201cThe brands got an introduction to a different kind of shopper, while the shoppers got introductions to the brands,\u201d adding, \u201cThere are always things you want to do differently, but anytime you have Mayor Bloomberg and Diane Von Furstenberg showing up for events, you\u2019ve done something right.\u201d", "Asked about the most valuable lessons gleaned from the first Dragon Week, Noble said one of the biggest takeaways \u2014 particularly for brands and companies that are just now turning their attention to the China market \u2014 is that the Chinese demographic is not one monolith but rather consists of several segments. While Dragon Week attendees included a smattering of first-time travelers from mainland China, the majority of guests were \u201cinternational Chinese,\u201d who are accustomed to living around the world, as well as many next-generation Chinese students based in the US. As such, a key educational point for the brands that held private events during Dragon Week was that these consumer segments display significant differences that need to be taken into account.", "However, one commonality that Noble noted across every group taking part in Dragon Week is that \u201caccess works.\u201d Said Noble, \u201cThe events that had a special draw or a chance to meet people like [Mayor] Bloomberg, Diane Von Furstenberg and Oscar [de la Renta], Lang Lang, those were packed.\u201d For events with brands less well-known among Chinese shoppers, attendance ranged from around a dozen to 40. The major learning from this observation, Noble added, \u201cis that events that come with [exclusive] access are going to bring in the crowds.\u201d", "Miss Universe China, Luo Zilin, takes part in a private fashion show at Bergdorf Goodman", "Another major educational point Noble took away from Dragon Week came down to customer acquisition and the way brands expect to cultivate consumer loyalty over the long term. Said Noble, Affinity China needs to \u201cfocus on the brand and PR building aspect of what we\u2019re doing for our partners and broaden their thinking about timing. It\u2019s not, \u2018I\u2019m going to make every dime back the week of the event,\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018I\u2019ve made this investment and I can get these people back [as customers] time and time again.'\u201d", "Overall, Noble added, Affinity learned what works and what doesn\u2019t work so well when bringing mainland Chinese shoppers and major brands together. Asked to elaborate, Noble said one thing that will be done differently in future Dragon Weeks in Hawaii, New York and elsewhere is to start promoting earlier. \u201cSo many in our target market in China go to the beach in Maldives or Thailand for Chinese New Year, so it\u2019s a bit harder to get them to come to New York in January, which is why we\u2019ll likely try to get them to come again in October.\u201d With Chinese outbound tourism \u2014 and spending by outbound tourists \u2014 expected to grow in the double digits for the next several years at the very least, it\u2019s clear that events like Dragon Week are coming in at the early side of a trend that will likely be highly profitable for brands prepared to cater to Chinese tourists, and less profitable for others.", "What it all comes down to is trial and error, Noble said. \u201cYou have to take a chance and stick your neck out a little bit to figure out what works, and then keep moving fast and do more of what works. We\u2019re really happy, especially when we look back at the events [this week] and our ability to recruit new members.\u201d", "\u201cIn terms of long-term value for our brand partners,\u201d Noble concluded, \u201cI\u2019ve got no worries.\u201d", "Tweet", "Follow @JingDaily ", "", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", "", "  "]}, {"title": "First Chinese Owned & Operated Gallery In Europe Opens In Berlin", "meta": "January 27, 2012", "paragraphs": ["Zhong Gallery's first exhibition, \u201cDawn: New Art from China,\u201d runs through March 31", "Opening its doors just in time for Chinese New Year celebrations, this week Zhong Gallery \u2014 the first Chinese owned and operated gallery space in Europe \u2014 made its debut in Berlin.

Second, any slowdown that may occur this year could be a good thing to prevent overheating and cultivate healthier markets.

The most pronounced trend recently taking shape among Chinese collectors \u2014 both new and established \u2014 is bidding for the best works by blue-chip Chinese contemporary artists, while remaining cool towards sub-par works. Much of this comes down to the buying priorities of Chinese collectors. Though many see collecting as a form of cultural preservation and others see it as a means to eventually opening private museums, others view collecting as a highly pragmatic activity, a bulwark against inflation, diminishing returns from cash holdings, and uncertain real estate and stock markets. As such, Chinese buyers will continue to make up an important contingent at auctions in Hong Kong, Paris, London and elsewhere as long as there is top-quality Chinese art (whether traditional or contemporary) up for grabs \u2014 regardless of the global economic climate.", "As TIME notes this week:", "So is a sudden drop around the corner? Experts say no, pointing to the broadening of the Asian art world over the last decade as a stabilizing force. Asian collectors, for example, are increasingly diversifying their collections, branching out into works from other countries. Taiwanese collectors, for instance, are buying more Indonesian art. A recent surge in new museums and galleries, particularly in China, where an average of one hundred new museums opens each year, as well as more academic art scholarship about Asian art, has also underpinned the market. All of which makes a precipitous collapse, according to Jehan Chu, director of Hong Kong-based art consultancy Vermillion Art Collections, \u201chard to imagine.\u201d", "Liu Ye's \"Night\" sold at Christie's in Hong Kong for US$1 million last November", "As TIME points out, a slowdown in one individual Asian market could simply translate to a boost for another. This factor has bolstered the Chinese art market for several years, as ethnic Chinese super-collectors from Indonesia, Singapore and elsewhere \u2014 among them Budi Tek, Woffles Wu, and Barry Lam \u2014 have spent millions amassing important collections of works by Zhang Xiaogang, Wang Guangyi, Xu Bing and Zeng Fanzhi. For their part, for the next several years we expect to see mainland Chinese collectors remain firmly fixated on the Chinese art market. But even if records stop falling at the rate we saw last spring, the fact remains that blue-chip Chinese artists remain undervalued vis-\u00e0-vis Western artists, and prices for top works should continue to tick upward as more Chinese collectors enter the market amid a tougher investment market.", "To prevent the market from overheating or attracting an excessive number of speculators looking to make a quick buck, a few months to catch its breath could be just what the Chinese art market \u2014 if not the Asian market as a whole \u2014 needs.", "Tweet", "Follow @JingDaily ", "", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", "", "  "]}, {"title": "Pianist Lang Lang Performs At Montblanc Flagship In New York (Photos)", "meta": "January 24, 2012", "paragraphs": ["Lang Lang arrives at the event (Photo courtesy Creative Brand Company)", "Marking the launch of Dragon Week, a series of private events in New York organized by the membership-based network\u00a0Affinity China and the China Luxury Network, yesterday China\u2019s most famous classical pianist, Lang Lang, gave an invitation-only performance at the Montblanc flagship on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

But another beneficiary that stands to profit from the Chinese New Year luxury spending spree is the humble pawnshop, thousands of which have popped up throughout China in the last decade. As the Economic Observer recently noted in its profile of China\u2019s \u201cgift economy,\u201d luxury consumption with the intention of gift-giving is part and parcel of the country\u2019s holiday celebrations, and has in many ways shaped the Chinese luxury market as a whole since the first stirrings of market economy reforms in the late 1970s. As the article points out, \u201cGifts have always been the most effective lubricant in human interaction [in China]. In both urban and rural settings, a gift is a means of developing one\u2019s power and profiting in return. The hunger to consolidate power and wealth among the elite and the nouveaux riche has vastly expanded the high-end gift market.", "In response to demand for these high-end gifts, we\u2019ve regularly seen a spike in the limited edition, often China-only offerings by luxury brands both large and small. With the pool of Chinese luxury consumers growing by the year, this has become particularly noticeable since 2009. In the run-up to 2012, the Year of the Dragon \u2014 generally considered a particularly auspicious year on the Lunar calendar \u2014 these localized collections have become more numerous than ever, with watchmakers like Piaget, Glash\u00fctte Original and\u00a0Blancpain joining the likes of Versace, Rolls-Royce, Shui Jing Fang baijiu and Shanghai Tang in emblazoning their products with commemorative dragons. While it\u2019s too early to gauge the general reaction in China to these collections \u2014 aside from the Rolls-Royce Year of the Dragon Phantom, which recently sold out despite a US$1.2 million price tag\u00a0\u2014 we can safely assume that they should go down better than last year\u2019s rabbit-infused items.", "As the Economic Observer holds, though, following this year\u2019s celebrations, many of these high-priced gifts will be destined for the pawnbroker:", "The busiest period of the pawn shops is thus right after the Spring Festival, i.e. the New Year holiday. All sorts of unneeded, unwanted and just plain valuable presents are taken to the shops for cash conversion. Since the price of gold has soared in the past two years, it has become once again the most popular and common item to turn in. \u201cAmong all luxury goods, watches remain the most common item, especially the famous Swiss ones like Vacheron Constantin, Rolex, Lange and Omega,\u201d says Kai Xin.", "Though we hear a great deal more about Chinese pawnshops in the wake of major holidays, they have quietly proliferated for quite some time. As Jing Daily noted in 2010, luxury watches started to show up in pawnshops in Beijing in the mid-\u201990s, with pawning activity increasing dramatically since around 2000 and creating big business in the Chinese capital and some of the country\u2019s wealthier cities. Cashing in unwanted luxury gifts is not restricted to pawnshops, though, as it\u2019s also fueled the growing number of second-hand luxury shops we\u2019ve seen cropping up throughout China following their boom years in Japan and, later, Hong Kong.

As the FT reports today, the French airport operator ADP (A\u00e9roports de Paris) recently announced plans for a \u201cwelcome scheme\u201d for Chinese tourists, its largest-ever such effort for a specific nationality, to make Chinese tourists arriving at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports \u201cfeel at home.\u201d", "As the FT\u2019s beyondbrics blog\u00a0notes, the ADP\u2019s plans for welcoming Chinese tourists include outfitting airports with Chinese New Year decorations and recruiting Mandarin-speaking officials to hand out traditional red envelopes (\u7ea2\u5305) containing a message by Pierre Graff, president of the ADP. Additionally, the ADP will broadcast messages in Mandarin and Cantonese, offer free guides to visitors and special discounts on specific luxury goods, and put out Chinese-language iPhone and Android travel apps.

Noting the massive rise in Chinese tourist arrivals in Paris over the past five years, the spokesperson added, the decision to organize the welcome scheme was an \u201cobvious\u201d one.", "But is it really that obvious?

From Australia (beaches, sun) to New York (real estate, education, culture) to Japan (skiing, cuisine), the increasing worldliness of Chinese outbound tourism means touting shopping venues as well as cultural or experiential offerings will fall on more receptive ears.

Along with a slew of photos, the app includes Chinese-language information and news about each designer or brand, and lets users see more conversations taking place on Sina Weibo. This integration takes on one of the biggest obstacles faced by brands looking to tap consumer spending in China: too much noise in the industry. As Anina puts it, \u201cThe fashion conversation is currently scattered in China, and our app helps readers quickly find out what is the buzz around these new fashion brands.\u201d With the app, she adds, \u201cfashion trendsetters have the first view at the tip of their fingers without having to search for the conversation around the web.\u201d", "Though the app is currently loaded on Meego N9s, last week Anina told the Asian tech blog Penn-Olson that she plans to extend the Chinese version of the app to Windows Phone 7 (WP7) later this year, after Nokia phones running MP7 go on sale in China. The application is currently available in Traditional/Simplified Chinese, French, and English, with the Chinese version integrated with Sina Weibo and the French and English versions integrated with Facebook and Twitter.", "The app comes pre-installed on all Nokia N9s sold in China", "As Anina told Jing Daily this week, the main motivation for 360Fashion\u2019s Social News app is to help consumers stay plugged in to important news, discover designers and collections that are either new or new to them, and to help brands build lucrative buzz in the China market. By testing out the response to their new collections among users, brands can better prepare their China roll-outs ahead of time, or even test the waters to see if the time is right to enter the China market at all. Said Anina, \u201cThe biggest mistake in fashion is that brands do not prepare well enough in advance with press, online press, social media, and mobile [platforms] before they even set foot into China.\u201d", "Added Anina, the Chinese consumer shops like this: First they look into what others are saying about a given brand, and check to see if it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d on social media networks. Then the shopper reads news about the brand. If both are positive, and reception among their peer group is good, they\u2019ll definitely go into a store or buy online. In the next update of the Chinese-language 360Fashion Social News app, mapping will be added to let brands direct customers to their local stores.", "One of the key advantages of the app, particularly from the industry side, is that it features in-season collections. Unlike many online or print publications that feature upcoming collections, shoppers can browse winter collections during the winter season, for example. This is a benefit for emerging brands, particularly from the intellectual property standpoint. As Anina notes, many outlets expose fashion brands\u2019 new collections before the selling period is finished and the clothing has gone into production, which \u201cweakens them in the BRIC markets because their designs can be copied.\u201d Though users can zoom in to look at design features of new collections, photos can\u2019t be saved, only browsed and discussed via social media.", "Anina receives a top partnership award, presented by Nokia CEO Stephen Elop", "From the standpoint of Western brands, the app is useful to take help gain competitive advantage in the China market by learning more about the designs, color schemes and tastes of domestic Chinese fashion designers. This is a niche that Anina says is important for international brands to crack. There are few platforms now, particularly in the mobile space, actively scouting for the best young Chinese designers and giving them a means to interact with future customers. (While also providing helpful clues for bigger brands.)", "\u201cAlso,\u201d Anina points out, the app helps young designers \u201ctake advantage of the emerging upper class, who is evolving and looking for unknown brands, so they can one-up their nouveau-riche friends.\u201d", "\u201cBy creating a platform for young designers to gain exposure, we can help the industry grow from the long tail side.\u201d", "The Social News app with look books is available for Meego Nokia N9s in China.

Though the country continues to produce more aspiring collectors every year, instrumental to the growth of the Chinese collector market has been a handful of \u201csuper-collectors,\u201d ultra-wealthy buyers who spend millions every year amassing huge collections of traditional and contemporary Chinese art. Championing their own artists and pushing prices for modernist Chinese painters like Zhang Daqian and Qi Baishi \u2014 as well as contemporary artists like Zhang Xiaogang, Zeng Fanzhi and Yue Minjun \u2014 into the millions of dollars, the appetite of these super-collectors for art saw the modernists, Zhang and Qi, surpass Picasso and Warhol to become the world\u2019s most valuable artists at auction in 2011 despite low name recognition outside of China.  Aside from pushing up prices for Chinese artists, perhaps the most interesting role played by Chinese super-collectors is their ability to shape the buying habits of new, small-scale collectors. New collectors less well-versed in Chinese art typically follow high-profile collectors like Liu Yiqian and his wife Wang Wei (who will open their first private museum in Shanghai this November) and auto mogul Yang Bin.  This week, the Wall Street Journal profiles Yang Bin, noting that Yang\u2019s influence among his wealthy network of friends is emblematic of the way super-collectors play the role both of buyer and taste-maker within China. From the article:", "Mr. Yang, age 54 and one of Beijing\u2019s biggest car dealers, is emblematic of the new wave of Chinese collectors: Over the past decade, he has collected nearly 1,000 artworks by contemporary heavyweights like Chen Yifei, who paints women in romantic interiors, and Zhang Xiaogang, known for haunting family portraits. Mr. Yang\u2019s art choices are closely tracked by the region\u2019s top collectors and dealers. He has financed the opening of a pair of edgy art galleries in Beijing, one of which is managed by his wife, Yan Qing. Last year he began importing and reselling collectible wines like Bordeaux. (He keeps most of his own 30,000-bottle collection stored in a cellar outside town.) The collectors in his broader circle include Qiao Zhibing, a nightclub owner based in Shanghai. Mr. Qiao is outfitting his four-story karaoke bar, Shanghai Night, with conceptual sculptures by Ai Weiwei, sleek photographs of Champagne-drinking partygoers by Yang Fudong and paintings of men in suits and smiling face masks by Zeng Fanzhi. Behind Mr. Qiao\u2019s cashier\u2019s desk looms Beijing artist Ji Dachun\u2019s large painting of an eyeball.  ", "Yue Minjun is another auction favorite among influential Chinese collectors", "\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s not enough in China to be wildly wealthy,\u201d says Meg Maggio, director of P\u00e9kin Fine Arts, a Beijing gallery specializing in contemporary art. \u201cFor all these guys, it\u2019s about building a beautiful way of life\u2014they want the nice objects, the good wine, the whole package.\u201d", "While the influx of new, completely \u201cgreen\u201d collectors has raised eyebrows in China, as buyers without the means to buy works from blue-chip Chinese artists have, in some cases, pushed up prices for less established artists to unsustainable levels, the desire among aspiring collectors to invest in art to diversify away from real estate or the stock market is fueling the emergence of many art products. As Artvest noted this week, Chinese investors have started at least eight art funds in recent months, in the hopes of buying top-quality artwork and reselling at a profit.  Considering there are only about 20 such funds elsewhere in the world, the WSJ points out, this is an important development, and something to keep a close eye on. This will be particularly true if influential collectors decide to start their own funds, and get their wealthy friends involved, in 2012.

According to Hong Kong\u2019s Standard, the protest turnout was so great that the store was forced to shut its doors before 3:00 PM as the crowds gathered, with other shops nearby closing early as well as crowds spilled over.

The hundreds of angry comments now posted in English on Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s Facebook wall from Hong Kong attest to this. In contrast, other recent China-related PR crises \u2014 such as complaints by former workers at Gucci China that the brand was operating essentially a sweatshop in southern China \u2014 remained largely localized and were less widely reported in the global English-language\u00a0press.", "Dolce & Gabbana, photographed in Beijing late last year (Image: Prestige HK)", "Ignoring Hong Kong\u2019s Internet-mobilized sense of solidarity against what many perceive as belittlement is the worst thing a luxury brand can do, and as such every brand operating in Hong Kong (or, really, anywhere) needs a defined and localized crisis management plan. Taking the high rate of penetration of global social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter in Hong Kong (and the city\u2019s more open tabloid and online press) into consideration is key, as is the understanding of how locals are reacting to the influx of extremely wealthy mainland Chinese tourist-shoppers now populating shopping districts like Tsim Sha Tsui and Central.", "Whether the allegations against D&G in Hong Kong are actually true or not has become a secondary issue. The brand\u2019s failure to come out with at least an apology and a vow to investigate the claims within the first 24 hours of the initial article is now at the forefront.

But on the other hand, so far the sophistication of media \u2014 in terms of magazine, newspaper, TV, and editorial content \u2014 relative to where we are is very different. I think China is still in an early phase in terms of trying to understand media, marketing and advertising, and how to reach and influence the best customer. So that\u2019s a big challenge. That\u2019s something I think we can figure out together. ", "The last piece is about consumers. If you look at the research, the best thing I\u2019ve seen on the consumer side is the work that American Express has done with the Harrison Group. They defined four categories of sophistication, in terms of how people regionally and globally buy and think about buying, and where they are in their mindset about buying luxury. The four categories from the most nouveau to the most sophisticated are\u00a0acquisitive, inquisitive, authoritative, and meditative. What they are saying is that China, Russia, and maybe India are acquisitive. The bigger the brand, the more you can brag about how much it costs, and the happier you are. Show and display. That\u2019s acquisitive.", "Inquisitive is not so much about showing off anymore. \u201cI want more to know why it\u2019s worth of money I\u2019m paying, and what constitutes the great piece of fine jewelry, the great travel experience , the great dinner, the great wine. I am curious.\u201d That\u2019s inquisitive, and it\u2019s an early learning stage.", "Authoritative is not even too much about stuff. It\u2019s about quality, value, understanding, and appreciation \u2014 I don\u2019t care about travel agents, I got an opinion too. It\u2019s much more about the interrelationship between price and value. That\u2019s where America, Europe and Japan are living, and going forward to meditative since the 1970s.", "Meditative is nothing to do about stuff. It\u2019s spiritual. It\u2019s more about experience and what\u2019s really unique. It\u2019s much less materialistic. The interesting thing is that it took Europe, Japan and the US about 40 years (since the 1970s) to move up that food chain from acquisitive to meditative. Most of the research shows that it will only take China 15 years or less to be meditative because the hunger to know is so pronounced.", "\u00a0", "Betty Chen of Jing Daily talked with Gregory Furman", "JD: How do luxury brand meet the demands of Chinese consumers?", "GF: One of the great statistics from the presentation made by Fortune Character [in Shanghai last month] showed that Chinese luxury consumers are ten years younger than any other luxury consumer in the world. So all of the sudden the country has an incredibly robust and intelligent population. They are going to be at a very sophisticated level very soon, so brands are going to have to keep pace with them. Brands have to meet that at a store level, with a level of sophisticated patience and service. The customers there are going to be smarter and demand more, so brands have to meet their rising tastes. ", "One of the other issues for many brands is that there is a whole mid-management gap. If you look at some of the studies, one of the issues for brands is people in China at a mid-management level are very good at implementing and taking orders, or following doing the right thing. People there are very scrupulous. But culturally speaking, some research shows that brands have had a hard time in terms of getting people to take risks and make recommendations. Part of the job for mid-level managers in Europe, the US and Japan is to think about the business, so China has a massive challenge in terms of educating people in\u00a0understanding\u00a0the whole structure of management. That type of education is one of the things the [Luxury Marketing] Council would like to talk about.", "JD: Do you see any members in the US interested in forming relationships with Chinese companies to sell their products in China and vice versa?", "GF: I think every brand has to be involved. If you are a global brand, you have to be there. For brands in China, I think it\u2019s the same, and this is interesting. For example, Shanghai Tang is one of them. One of the issues for mainland China is that a Chinese brand that wants to have a global luxury presence needs to raise its levels of sophistication and product service. Another special resource is the Web. I think there are enormous opportunities for young designers from around the world in this regard. That\u2019s a part we think we could play a role in.", "JD: Do you have any specific ideas, in mind in terms of bringing them together?", "GF: Yes. Let\u2019s meet some here, and bring them to China. Let\u2019s meet them in China, and bring them to the US. Let\u2019s have the Council bring some of the smartest Chinese designers here and let our members meet them and introduce them to one another. We can get some universities involved. Sometimes very simple things are very powerful. You have to find people and you have to have people help you find people, and then bring them together. Bring the right people together, do simple things, and duplicate them.", "JD: The first \u201cChina\u2019s Luxury Report\u201d by the Luxury Marketing Council, UIBE (University of International Business & Economics) and Fortune Character made its debut at the Luxury Market in China summit. Do you have any plans to distribute the report here?", "GF: The report is great and it was a very good presentation. I think we are going to distribute it here once it\u2019s translated.", "JD: What\u2019s your personal perspective of the Chinese luxury market? Compared with the US luxury market, what kinds of differences do you see in terms of the culture of luxury and consumer attitudes?", "GF: From the standpoint of the growth of the market, if you look at studies like the ones McKinsey\u00a0has done about China, they are saying confidently that by 2015 China will account for 25 percent of global purchases of all luxury products and services. The other thing they are saying is by 2025 China will account for 50 percent. ", "That\u2019s just one perspective. Another perspective is from the standpoint of the development of consumers, in terms of migration from acquisitive to\u00a0inquisitive to\u00a0authoritative to meditative. In 10 years, they are going to be further up the food chain, so the pressure will be on brands to sell to Chinese consumers face-to-face and through more sophisticated marketing vehicles. That\u2019s going to be a revolution, and it\u2019s happening very quickly.", "In China, there are 200 or 300 big cities. Many brands thought going into different cities in China would be just like going to different cities in the US. In fact, it\u2019s more like traveling between Italy, Germany, and England all within China. Cities in China are so different, culturally. A brand that works in a city\u00a0equivalent\u00a0to New York does not mean it\u2019s going to work in a city equivalent to London or Paris. One of the challenges for brands is to understand the culture and differences of big cities where they have opportunities, in terms of taste, color and style. My point is, stylistically there are differences in China city by city. So brands have to figure that out.", "Media is another major thing we need to discuss. Brands need to be\u00a0sophisticated\u00a0in knowing what advertising means in China \u2014 how do you reach the right people, how do you segment the population by lifestyle \u2014 and it\u2019s a very early phase in China now. Then there\u2019s issues of privacy, openness, freedom of information and exchange: Where is the government playing in that and how much is appropriate, how can brands capture information and be allowed to use it? One thing I know is that not too long ago, luxury advertising was banned [in Beijing] and companies were at risk of being fined for using the world \u201cluxury.\u201d ", "I think wealth disparity in China is also something that brands should address. It\u2019s not a major issue only in China, but globally. Brands need to be more sensitive and have a greater sense of consciousness.", "Special thanks to Gregory Furman and the\u00a0Luxury Marketing Council.

Can you tell us a little bit about your experience there?", "Gregory Furman (GF): Yes. Thanks to Steven Yao who is the publisher of Fortune Character and his team, Jessica Tu, who is one of my partners in China, and Savio Chan, who is my partner in the US. It was an amazing experience. I saw\u00a0probably 400 leaders in government, business, luxury, professional services and consulting. The audience was a mix of people from business, the arts, and, importantly, academia, which I think is the future of marketing. I always believe that it\u2019s critical for these three sectors to work more closely together, especially as the world becomes more global. It was a beautifully organized event, and the content, I thought, was first-class. I learned a great deal and I met lots of fabulous people, and came home with something like 100 cards. ", "I\u2019ve never been anywhere where I felt as welcome and warm, as\u00a0probably\u00a0treated like a celebrity more than I deserved, but people seemed interested in what I had to say. I did one of the keynotes, and I think it was well received. I talked about how important the partnership between the US and China will be, going forward, and talked about growing up in an American working-class family. In my opening remarks, I said that I think China is now where the United States was in late \u201940s and early \u201950s, which is to say that hard work and education are what are going to make the country move forward very quickly. My other impression during my many trips to China has been the hunger to succeed and the hunger to learn, and I don\u2019t think there is any place in the world as powerful as China now in this sense.", "JD: What motivated the Luxury Marketing Council to launch a Chapter in China, and why now?", "GF: Well, sometimes it\u2019s a matter of luck and circumstance. One answer is that I had to be in a situation in which the Council had reached critical mass to allow me to be credible globally as a global thought leader. That took some time, for me to grow the council from 32 companies in New York in 1995 to 1,000 brands now in 37 cities with more than 5,000 CEOs and CMOs. And the other was it took a while for me to meet people as great as Jessica, Savio and Steven. I always believe that in business, you have to be at the right place at the right time. So I think at exactly the same time when China was moving, the Council was moving. Also, the Council has reached the level of maturity where we\u2019ve learned a lot from research and all the things we\u2019ve done. China is just beginning to move like a great engine, and there has been maybe no time in history in which China has been as hungry to have luxury and a better life. I think now is a great time to be there.", "JD: What kinds of functions will the Council\u2019s China chapter have, and what kinds of events will it organize?", "GF: The functions of the China chapter are to be a thought leader in every segment of retail, consulting, and publishing so as to better serve the best customers, to better educate the best customers about what makes luxury worth the price. Also, to partner with government and academia to help brands be more intelligent in China, to train and educate people who serve the best customers, and to help everybody make money and profit in the process. In the US and globally, the Luxury Marketing Council is more B2B, but I think in China the major opportunity, especially in terms of educating young people, who are coming out of school and want to find employment with luxury brands, is helping them be better educated on how to be credible in the eyes of luxury brands and intelligent facing the best consumer. That\u2019s a big B2C opportunity. ", "There is also a B2E (employee) opportunity in China, in terms of working with\u00a0existing\u00a0brands and training\u00a0existing\u00a0staff. I think there are more opportunities to better educate the best consumer on how to better appreciate what luxury is, which is something that is still true in the US. One of the things that China and US have in common is that only 10 percent of the big money in the US is inherited or held among celebrities. The other 90 percent are people like me: first generation, education, and hard-working. China and the US can learn together on how to profit, as both of our markets mature.", "JD: Is there anything unique about the China chapter of the Luxury Marketing Council vis-a-vis other chapters?", "GF: The Luxury Marketing Council in the US is a membership model. Companies pay to play, and it\u2019s invitation-only. They really do want to understand best practices, so last year in New York we did 46 events. We look to serve here in the States as an intelligent broker to inspire companies to collaborate and partner with one another. Right now, we\u2019re wrestling with how successful that might be in China, and I think our instinct is to figure out some ways to collaborate intelligently with government and academia to understand how we all see the opportunity, and then to pick areas where we can work together most productively once we define those opportunities. I think there we have to start from a slightly different prospective.", "JD: As you said, many Luxury Marketing Council members in New York are CEOs and CMOs from luxury goods and services companies, so what kind of\u00a0criteria\u00a0are needed to become a member of China chapter?", "GF: I think the criteria are probably very similar. We focus on globally recognized luxury brands across all categories and every segment of retail. I think in China, the brands we want to align and work with will be all of the obvious ones, meaning the great luxury brands that we would all put on a list on our top 200. These brands already have a presence in China. We would also consider all of the great Chinese brands in areas like retail, consulting, publishing, web design, corporate identity, professional services, trade centers, universities. We are credible, since we have been doing this for 18 years, and we all need to learn one from another.", "Check back later this week for part two of our interview with Gregory Furman.

JNBY, for example, has built a great sales partnership in New York. Second, Chinese designers need to kick up their design capabilities to fit in with international standards when they look to interpret Asian design.

China International Fashion Week is organized by the China Fashion Designers Association, so it can get many nationwide fashion brands involved. In that Fashion Week, one can win the title of \u201cTop Ten Chinese Designer,\u201d which does a lot to help promote a brand. Shanghai Fashion Week is organized by the Shanghai Garment Trade Association, so it can really only get local brands involved. However, this year Shanghai Fashion Week got a nod from the Ministry of Commerce as a national event, so we\u2019ll see. ", "Compared to the four major Fashion Weeks overseas, China\u2019s Fashion Weeks are still essentially local events, which means it\u2019s tough for them to attract major media attention. Also, the role of Fashion Week in China as a trade platform isn\u2019t that important yet, so there\u2019s really a small proportion of buyers in the audience. Fashion buyer shops are still in their infancy here.", "JD: In recent years, cross-border partnerships between designers and artists and fashion and luxury brands have become more frequent. What do you think will be the impact of this kind of cross-border partnership on China\u2019s art world, fashion industry and luxury market?", "YQZ: Cross-border cooperation has really become a trend, an important way for new designers to emerge. Every season, for its new collection release, the Danish shoe brand Ecco finds a local designer to create a runway collection, and both the brand and the designer show up on the press release. Cooperation with international brands is a good way for [Chinese] designers to promote themselves. In the years ahead, this kind of cross-border cooperation will probably only become more popular. For Chinese designers who haven\u2019t found a successful way to develop their brands, it\u2019s a good way to bring in some income as well as attract more media attention.", "JD: You\u2019ve previously mentioned in articles, as we have, that many luxury brands are focusing on second- and third-tier cities in search of business opportunities after gaining rapid growth in top-tier cities. Compared to first-tier cities, what kind challenges do you think brands need to address in second- and third-tier cities?", "YQZ: The main challenge is talent. There aren\u2019t enough qualified\u00a0professionals that can be trained in such a limited period.\u00a0\u00a0Second, high-end commercial developments in these smaller cities aren\u2019t nearly good enough. For example, brands need to ask themselves: Is there an appropriate location to set up shop? Are property managers professional? Gucci previously encountered these issues at its Shenzhen location. Some problems shouldn\u2019t be problems from the beginning. ", "\u00a0", "", "JD: As fashion gradually progresses from \u201cmade-in-China\u201d to \u201cdesigned-in-China,\u201d how do you think China\u2019s upstart luxury brands can become more international?", "YQZ: Instead of waiting for others to understand us, we need to use international languages and operational models to cater to the needs of the world. We need to actually make valuable products, too, rather than just saying or writing about our fashion and luxury goods. Also, in terms of the outside environment, the government should play a supporting role, offering tax breaks, intellectual property protection and other things.", "JD: In your opinion, are China\u2019s luxury consumers more fashion-oriented or luxury-oriented? Do you foresee attitudes towards consumption shifting in the future?", "YQZ: Well, currently, China\u2019s luxury consumers are clearly more concerned about elements of luxury. It\u2019s a must to show social status through the price or displaying logos. This conception of consumption will change, but it needs more time. Shifts in Chinese industry come in gradients, so it\u2019s going to be the same in terms of consumption. After\u00a0conspicuous\u00a0consumers turn to personal consumers, China\u2019s new rich will become conspicuous consumers. ", "JD: Can you say something about the impact of micro-blogs, blogs and social networks on China\u2019s fashion industry? How can brands make better use of new media to interact with fashion-hungry netizens?", "YQZ: The impact of micro-blogs is enormous. Now, almost every brand has its own social media platform. Blogs and social networking are important supplements for micro-blogs as well. It\u2019s very important to reach opinion leaders who can find the right brands and really like a certain set of brands on a personal level. It\u2019s critical to establish good relationships with fashion-focused netizens. And what I mean is a sort of friendship between a brand and its buyers, rather than a simple business relationship.

Built to educate local drinkers, many of whom have long been accustomed to watering down whisky with sweetened green tea, or seeing cognac as the only premium imported spirit on the market, the three-story Johnnie Walker House takes visitors on a step-by-step tour through the production and enjoyment of whisky.", "Beginning with an introduction to the raw materials of whisky \u2014 barley, water and peat \u2014 upon entering, guests to the Johnnie Walker House are taken through an \u201cexperience\u201d that includes a detailed copper scale model of a Scottish distillery and high-tech, interactive sensory table that teaches visitors the fundamental aromatic and tasting notes of Scotch whisky. Finally, after having been filled in on the basics of whisky appreciation, guests are led to the third-floor lounge for a tasting session led by one of the House\u2019s resident experts.", "For the Johnnie Walker House, owners Diageo have spared no expense. The dimly lit spaces emulate a private residence, albeit one with floors lain with re-purposed oak barrels and chandeliers fashioned from crystal highball glasses. But with whisky still more widely known as a mixer more than a premium spirit in China, and well-heeled Chinese still regularly opting for cognac or rare wines for personal enjoyment or gift-giving, can the Johnnie Walker House change perceptions of whisky and transform whisky culture in China? Jing Daily recently made a trip down to Sinan Mansions to put these questions to Lawrence Law, brand director at Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Diageo, at the Johnnie Walker House.", "Jing Daily (JD): As Johnnie Walker entered, or rather re-entered, China quite recently, what\u2019s been the biggest obstacle here in terms of competition? What\u2019s your strategy for turning cognac drinkers into Scotch drinkers?", "Lawrence Law (LL): I think from a cognac perspective, cognac has been here for the longest time, far longer than whisky historically. A lot of the imported spirits culture in China is largely driven by the Hong Kongers and Taiwanese who ring along the coastline. So you\u2019ll notice in the north, for example, people are often still drinking baijiu rather than whisky. From our point of view, one reason for building the House is to bring Scotch into China and give Chinese a different perspective of it. ", "If you look at the last 10 years, Scotch has been relatively unknown in China. It\u2019s largely consumed by younger drinkers in bars. But what I think the strategy with the House is, aside from giving people the chance to learn about whisky in its purest form outside of Scotland, is it gives us the ability to give Scotch a much more premium image. And not just for Johnnie Walker. I think, obviously, building a place like this is really making a statement, that we are one of the leading whisky houses in the world, and we have a wide range apart from the commonly known Black Label. We have highly limited editions that cost as much as premium cognacs. ", "So I think that this place is a way to \u201cpremium-ize\u201d our brand in China as well as educate consumers about whisky in general. ", "\u00a0", "", "JD: You\u2019re located at Sinan Mansions, surrounded by many higher-end restaurants and shops, which to some visitors could be somewhat intimidating. Is that part of the reason tours are laid out in stages, to make guests more comfortable?", "LL: We chose Sinan Mansions because, from a location perspective, we think that this is the next up-and-coming Xintiandi. I think right now Xintiandi is becoming a lot more commonly known as a tourist spot. [Sinan Mansions] is one of the few places that has been recently done up as a historical area, preserving some of the old Shanghai houses. In terms of intimidation, we haven\u2019t experienced that. And partly, I think, that\u2019s because this is more of a destination than a place for people to just walk in. Over the last two months, we have had maybe 500 or 600 guests here, trade customers as well as friends bringing friends. I think what we\u2019ve done here is to compartmentalize the experience, from the first floor to the second floor to the third floor. I think this helps them absorb it in the right way, rather than throwing all of the information at them in one go. ", "JD: The way the stages go, starting with the raw materials of whisky and ending up on the third floor actually drinking the finished product, do you think that\u2019s something the local customers appreciate? Is that kind of sense-heavy approach something critical for the premium spirits market in China?", "LL: When we built this place, we spoke to many guests and what we found is that when you take them through the stages, if you just let them taste the whisky and that\u2019s it, they\u2019ll say \u201cYes.\u201d That\u2019s very Chinese in nature \u2014 saying, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d But they don\u2019t actually know. So if you look at the process, going through the raw materials and teaching them what a distillery looks like inside and out with a model, taking them to the second floor to open their senses at the scent table, by the time they get to the third floor and taste the whisky, they can actually taste a lot more because their minds have opened up. And I think that\u2019s extremely important when we talk about a premium whisky. ", "Here, we talk about the craftsmanship behind whisky, we talk about the 10 million casks in Scotland that we can take advantage of for blending custom bottles. Visitors get the full spectrum here. So we\u2019ve been right with our strategy so far, I think, because the way we lead guests through the House teaches them to appreciate the differences between standard and premium Scotch.", "JD: What are your observations on the tastes of different people who come here from different places in China? How do tastes broadly differ?", "LL: If you look at the dinners we do here, the food that we pair the whiskies with, we tend to use Shanghainese food as the baseline. But there are definitely different perspectives when you go to other areas in the south, like Xiamen or Guangzhou, where people are broadly lovers of seafood. We have educational programs there in restaurants where we teach people how to pair with seafood. Since people still mostly drink cognac in the north, we\u2019re exploring how to educate people on pairing with food in the north. We haven\u2019t yet looked too much into pairing Scotch with the hot and spicy flavors in places like Chengdu, because cuisine there can be quite strong and a lot of people still like to pair that kind of food with baijiu.", "So our focus is still mostly in the south and the more cosmopolitan cities like Beijing and Shanghai. In the south there\u2019s a large drinking culture during dinner, and it\u2019s a combination of whisky, cognac and baijiu, while in the north it\u2019s still mostly baijiu. Right now the low-hanging fruit is in the south, where we can educate people on how to bring whisky into their dining occasions. In the north we have to start somewhere, but our priorities are still positioning ourselves in the current drinking culture rather than trying to change the drinking culture itself.", "JD: In terms of generational differences, which are pretty noticeable in most segments of the luxury industry here, are you targeting younger drinkers? Or are you mostly focusing on middle-aged consumers, as Scotch makers often do in the US and UK?", "LL: If you look at the segmentation strata in China, it can be quite complex, because you\u2019ve got [outliers like] the young entrepreneurs and the \u201csecond generation rich\u201d kids. I guess to put it into perspective, if you look at the younger generation, they\u2019re trying to experiment with imported spirits, and we don\u2019t usually take them through the full experience [at the Johnnie Walker House]. We tend to use more fun, energetic marketing for them. For example, we recently did the Yulu campaign, which was\u00a0energetic and thought-provoking for the younger generation. And it\u2019s been the most successful campaign we\u2019ve ever run in China. It\u2019s been seen by something like 20 million people online, and that\u2019s going to reposition the brand as a whole. ", "If you look at the premium side, this location is a lot more for \u2014 we don\u2019t talk about age, we talk about affordability \u2014 anybody who can afford Blue Label and above. Essentially, we have two different experiences we\u2019re going for in China, one more energetic and another more premium. If you look at cognac, for example, the older generation don\u2019t really drink whisky as much because they\u2019re still drawn to cognac. So we\u2019re trying to educate customers about the craftsmanship and flavors of whisky. You kind of have to have whisky, you can\u2019t just have cognac as a pleasure in life.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: Do you find now that whisky is becoming a more accepted business drink in China?", "LL: It\u2019s still in the early stages. If you look at the House itself, we do allow people to buy and consume immediately, and when we have business occasions here and bring people together, they\u2019ll easily open a bottle of 1910 and drink it on the spot. But all of this takes a bit of time, we don\u2019t expect it to accelerate to [the level of cognac] so quickly. As long as we bear in mind that what we\u2019re trying to do here is build a whisky culture, whether it\u2019s in leisure and business, people will start to follow. So the answer, I would say, is that it\u2019s in the early stages, but we expect to see that start changing. ", "If you look at the recent [Mid-Autumn Festival] gifting season, we had more orders of limited editions than ever before, because people are giving whisky as a business gift, not just for personal gifts.\u00a0It\u2019s a very important entry point. I think gifting is still one of the key channels to making us more widespread.", "JD: In addition to building the house and educating consumers, what, like getting gift boxes right, has been the biggest challenge in terms of getting mobilized for the Shanghai market?", "LL: I\u2019m not sure if there have been challenges, more than anything it\u2019s been insightful for us. Because many times when we create new experiences or gift packages, it\u2019s seen through the lens of a Chinese luxury consumer. And one of the luxuries we\u2019ve had is that even though we\u2019re a global brand, what we\u2019re doing is very much for local consumers. And based on what we\u2019ve found through talking with people here who\u2019ve come by, I think we can say we\u2019ve hit upon the right formula. The recent festival sales have been a good proof point that what we\u2019ve done here in terms of limited editions and packaging has been good. And I think it\u2019s quite basic. If make a good drink and have good packaging, it will move here. If we\u2019ve got the right elements, the right insights, the right price points, business will be good.", "JD: What do you think it is about Scotland that is so appealing to luxury consumers here? Golf, cashmere, whisky \u2014 it\u2019s almost like Scotland is a counterpoint to France in the Chinese luxury industry. I\u2019d be curious to get your thoughts on that concept.", "LL: Well, I think Scotland is a relatively unknown destination, and I think a lot of people here just know Scotland in terms of cashmere and whisky, these are the two main exports we see. And I think that the way we talk about Scotland has changed perceptions of it being more of an industrial place than a destination that has the right landscapes, scenery, and experiences. In fact, we do customized tours to Scotland as a service for some of our more premium customers, because we have a Scottish heritage team that sits on the global team. I think a lot of things we\u2019re doing is helping consumers understand what Scotland is all about. If you look at New Zealand, for a long time it has been considered a luxurious destination\u00a0in China, and I think Scotland will be seen as a premium location in China in coming years as well.", "JD: Earlier on the tour, you mentioned that you often encourage local visitors to experiment with drinking whisky with a bit of water to open up the aromas. Do you find that after going through the experience here, that people still like to mix whisky with sweet green tea or other things?", "LL: I\u2019m confident that what we\u2019re doing is changing the way people are consuming whisky. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re changing it for everybody, but I think the people who\u2019ve gone through the tour are teaching their friends how to appreciate whisky. I know we\u2019re making positive changes, at least among the people who come here and regularly come back. They never ask for Scotch mixed with green tea anymore. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I\u2019ll say, if you want to mix something into your drink, don\u2019t even bother with Scotch, try vodka, which is alcohol in its purest form. And on the tour, we explain how visitors can try it in different ways, like on its own, with one cube of ice, two cubes of ice, with water, with soda. The different spectrums of the flavors come out, and every individual will find the one he or she likes the best. I\u2019m confident we\u2019re changing the culture. The people we bring here do have influence over their friends and social circles, so it will help.", "Also, if you look at the promotions we work on with partners and bars, it\u2019s moving away from green tea. If we talk about Gold Label, we know we can\u2019t change mixing culture, but we give people tools to mix drinks in correct proportions. Like we have glasses that explain how much Gold Label to add, and how much water and ice. I think this is very fresh news for people interested in whisky, and getting them away from mixing with green tea or other mixers. It really helps us position away from our competitors. ", "We\u2019re not saying you can\u2019t do it, we\u2019re just saying the best way to drink it is up to you.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: How do you feel that whisky consumption at this level fits into the broader China luxury market, in terms of consumer taste and development?", "LL: We\u2019re doing our part to change the premium image of Scotch as a whole in China, and we\u2019re changing our packaging for this market as well, even for our standard Scotch bottles and packaging. If you look at our 1910 limited edition, the bottle is standard but the box is special. We also have changed our Blue Label bottle to make it heavier and weightier, because these are luxury cues we know the Chinese consumers want. If we keep using standard packaging, it\u2019s not going to work in China. This helps us reposition our products in the luxury space according to luxury trends in China.", "There are definitely luxury cues we look to here. One very interesting point about Chinese consumers is [the product still] has to look European. You look at our packaging and it\u2019s very European. They like that for some reason. When we talk about Johnnie Walker in China, especially our luxury labels, we talk about the rarity of the liquids in the bottles, they\u2019re over 50-60 years old, and we mention the three C\u2019s \u2014 the character of the liquid, the cask, and the craftsmanship behind it. These are cues the Chinese consumers like to hear. Chinese consumers have accelerated very quickly. If you look at just five years ago it was still very bling.

As Sotheby\u2019s Asia chairman Patti Wong recently pointed out, Chinese collectors, like all new collectors, remain fixated upon Chinese artists as \u201call cultures start with their own art.\u201d On the strength of growing demand, new Chinese collectors and even more established \u201csuper-collectors\u201d have, in the space of only three years, turned the Chinese contemporary art market on its head, pushing out many of the formerly dominant Western collectors who originally cultivated the segment a decade ago. This surging demand has fueled a \u201csecond boom\u201d in the Chinese art world, pushing prices for blue-chip artists to new highs in the years following the dip seen after the global economic crisis.", "Currently, as author and art critic Barbara Pollack told the AFP, \u201cChinese collectors are basically looking at Chinese art,\u201d a reality that pushed five Chinese artists to the list of the world\u2019s top 10 last year, as measured by combined sales at auction. (In all, 45 Chinese artists sit on the list of the world\u2019s 100 top sellers, according to Artprice.) While some names, like blue-chip contemporary artists like Zeng Fanzhi, Cai Guo-qiang and Zhang Xiaogang are known (and collected) internationally, many of these top sellers are all but unknown among Western collectors, which reflects the fact that Chinese collectors are no longer looking to the West to dictate auction trends. Said Pollack, \u201cThere are names which are totally fuelled by the Chinese market, some of them traditional ink painters, who are almost unheard of in the West.\u201d", "Yue Minjun \u2013 \u201cUntitled\u201d (2005). Chinese collectors tend to home in on blue-chip artists at auction", "With Chinese artists achieving higher visibility (and sales figures) back home, now we\u2019re starting to see them invited to show at Western art fairs, if only in earnest. As the AFP notes, despite growing participation from Asia, Africa and Latin America, these art fairs typically remain heavily weighted towards Europe and North America. This Euro-centric mindset, which often comes through in articles that contend China\u2019s booming art market is fueled mostly by unsophisticated collectors buying the \u201cwrong\u201d artwork at the \u201cwrong\u201d prices, is dismissed by Pollack, who holds, \u201cthe idea that we are going to teach [Chinese collectors] taste is very narrow minded.\u201d As gallerist Pearl Lam recently told Jing Daily, \u201ctaste\u201d among new Chinese collectors is highly fluid, as buying trends are often dictated by the same factors that are pushing the sales of luxury goods in China. Said Lam:", "If you want to see why artists like Zeng Fanzhi and Zhang Xiaogang attract such high prices, you just have to look at Chinese consumer behavior: they love labels. It\u2019s sort of a lack of confidence. They love Louis Vuitton, they love Christian Dior, and for them to buy a \u201clabel\u201d artist is also part of their fear of taking a risk. They don\u2019t want to make a mistake. Internationally it\u2019s the same phenomenon \u2013 you don\u2019t want to make a mistake.", "Beyond following the buying trends of their peers for fear of \u201cnot making a mistake,\u201d part of the reason new Chinese collectors tend to home in on blue-chip artists (when they can afford them) or pieces from popular historical eras (such as the reign of emperor Qianlong) is that they\u2019re not just buying art for the sake of enriching themselves culturally; They\u2019re buying for investment value. With inflation and yuan appreciation putting pressure on cash assets, and risk increasing for \u201cnon-portable\u201d investments like real estate and stocks, art is seen by many Chinese collectors as a comparatively safe hedge.", "What all this adds up to is that generalities about the Chinese art market, and Chinese collectors, rarely hold true. As Barbara Pollack pointed out last week, the increasing clout of Chinese collectors at auctions in mainland China, Hong Kong, or even in New York means traditional conceptions of the market should be thrown out. \u201cMany people in the West still think of the Chinese art market as a regional phenomenon,\u201d Pollack said.", "\u201cBut the size of it is beginning to prove it can no longer be ignored.

Likely a draw for the buyer was the clear provenance of the stools, acquired in Guangdong in the 1930s or \u201940s by the father of the present owner. Clear, easily verifiable provenance is a key selling point for mainland Chinese collectors in particular, who often prefer to purchase Chinese antiques in New York or London when possible, even over Hong Kong. Perhaps even more dramatic, though, was the sale of a rhinoceros horn archaistic cup from the 17th/18th century, which sold for $386,500, or nearly 10 times its high estimate of $40,000, and a late Shang Dynasty (12th/11th century BCE) bronze ritual tripod wine vessel, which sold for $902,500, over 15 times its high estimate of $60,000. Coming from a private Japanese collection, this vessel had been owned by the same family for 90 years.", "Though these auctions were held in New York, they reflect the buying habits of Chinese collectors and dealers in particular, and the strength of the bidding bodes well for the upcoming autumn auctions set to be held by Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong. These two auction houses show that they continue to be able to procure artwork and artifacts of clearer provenance and overall better quality than their counterparts in mainland China, China Guardian and Beijing Poly, and they\u2019re leveraging this fact to dominate in Hong Kong.

After the sale, which is expected to raise millions, Ullens will be able to put UCCA on a stronger foundation, while simultaneously seeding dozens of new art collections throughout mainland China and Hong Kong.

The 8-story, 52-room hotel, located at the north edge of Fuxing Park in the French Concession, occupies an enviable spot near increasingly touristy Xintiandi as well as the popular Sinan Mansions complex. Featuring an Art Deco aesthetic that echoes back to Old Shanghai and a contemporary art-filled modern interior, Pudi\u2019s interior and exterior design reflects the city\u2019s transformation and re-emergence as a style \u2014 rather than purely an economic \u2014 hub.", "Last week, Jing Daily sat down with Pudi\u2019s training & PR manager, Debra Duan to discuss what sets the hotel apart from the ever-growing list of five-star competitors appearing in the city. According to Duan, the hotel attracts a mix of about half foreign and half domestic guests, with Pudi\u2019s central location, large rooms \u2014 which range in size from 50-90 square meters \u2014 and in-room business centers the most commonly cited reasons for choosing the hotel.

When asked about the differences in taste in wine seen among Shanghainese and foreign guests, Yang said young Shanghainese tend to prefer New World wines from Australia and New Zealand, often try out domestic Chinese wines, and typically opt for Prosecco over champagne. Foreign guests, Yang observed, generally trend towards Old World wines. This, Yang added, indicates the differences in taste between Chinese in their 20s and 30s, who tend to be more flexible in their drinking habits, and middle-aged wine drinkers, who typically stick to French reds and little else.", "Pudi, unlike most five-star hotels in China, leans toward introducing guests to New World wines, rotating its menu by season. While New Zealand wines and Prosecco were highlighted this summer, in the fall the hotel will go mainly with South African Pinotage and Sauvignon Blanc, both of which, Kevin Yang said, are quite popular with young locals.", "Discussing what gives the Pudi its staying power in Shanghai\u2019s fickle and ever-expanding hotel market, Debra Duan said the hotel\u2019s focus on art has proven a consistent draw.

Gaining pace in the years preceding the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese capital has, perhaps more than any other city, seen its retail sector suffer from overcapacity, with new luxury-focused malls multiplying and ever more brands opening flagships and boutiques, even as the city\u2019s middle class has continued to search for deals online, done their luxury shopping in Hong Kong, and cultivated an increasingly vibrant second-hand luxury market.", "With rent at Beijing\u2019s many high-end malls continuing to rise, and consumers often using these venues for window-shopping more than anything else, some are wondering how the situation in Beijing can jibe with the news we see every day about China\u2019s booming luxury market. Yesterday, the Globe and Mail noted that exorbitant rental costs and oversaturation are mainly to blame for the woes facing Beijing\u2019s luxury shopping venues. Interestingly, in the article, one of the factors blamed for fewer shoppers at Beijing\u2019s malls was the inland shift of both brands and shopping centers. As Matthew Crabbe of Access Asia told the Globe and Mail, \u201cThe real market for luxury goods has moved out of Beijing and what is left is oversupply.\u201d", "So, if oversupply in top-tier cities \u2014 exacerbated by the fact that major brands have focused their expansion efforts on \u201cblank slate\u201d second- and third-tier cities, many of which are just now getting their first \u201creal\u201d luxury malls \u2014 is an unmistakable trend, where do the key opportunities now lie in China\u2019s vast and balkanized luxury market? This week, a report released by the Boston Consulting Group singles out three segments to watch: younger consumers, women, and consumers in smaller urban areas. While there\u2019s nothing\u00a0completely\u00a0fresh here \u2014 Jing Daily regularly covers the growing spending power of women, the increasingly young median age of Chinese luxury shoppers, and the promise of second-tier cities \u2014 it bears repeating that luxury brands both large and small need to tailor their expansion and marketing efforts to these three emerging groups.", "From China Daily\u2018s coverage of the new BCG report:", "\u201cConsumers in their late 20s to early 30s today outspent the national average by 18 percent, owing to structural changes in lifestyle: They know more brands, own more brands, trade up more often and have aspirations to upgrade in the future,\u201d said Zhou Yunling, project leader at BCG\u2019s Beijing office.", "Zhang Zhifeng, chairman of NE Tiger Fashion Co, a Chinese high-end dress manufacturer, told China Daily that the younger generation is among their buyers, although their target consumers are the wealthy.", "\u201cWe used to call young consumers the \u2018dream group\u2019 because our dress is more like a dream for them. They need to save money to buy a single article, which is usually priced at 20,000 yuan,\u201d Zhang said.", "\u201cHowever, the younger generation is now becoming important to our business,\u201d he said.", "Currently, spending on women\u2019s apparel constitutes 54 percent of the total spending on fashion among adult urban consumers \u2013 menswear spending represents 46 percent.", "Over the next 10 years, as women\u2019s incomes rise, it is expected that their apparel spending will pick up significantly, compared with that of men who earn the same amount, according to the report.", "\u201cWe are seeing the trend that women will continue to outspend men on apparel in China. The spending ratio between genders will likely converge with that of the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan in the future, where women spend 1.5 to 2.5 times what men do on apparel,\u201d Zhou said.", "Also, the report said that a much larger proportion of people who spend heavily on apparel will live in the country\u2019s lower-tier cities in the coming decade.", "\u201cTo reach 80 percent of the market potential for mid- and high-priced apparel, companies need to increase urban coverage from 462 cities in 2010 to 568 cities by 2020,\u201d Zhou said.", "The report goes on to point out that luxury e-commerce is another growing segment, with Vincent Lui of BCG saying, \u201cIn the following five years, nearly 40 million new e-shoppers will emerge [per] year, and the total e-shopper population in China is expected increase from roughly 145 million in 2010 to reach 329 million by 2015.\u201d Still, as Jing Daily has previously pointed out, though the luxury-focused online retail market may be a hot topic, it\u2019s by no means consolidated, and \u2014 much like Beijing\u2019s luxury market \u2014 is becoming more saturated by the day.", "Still, going back to top-tier luxury markets like Beijing, we would say that ample opportunity still exists despite the current difficulties faced by high-end malls.

While this trend might cause pain for some of the shopping centers built during the luxury frenzy of 2005-2010, and may even hurt the luxury giants who overextended in top-tier cities in recent years, it will benefit home-grown Beijing designers, lesser-known international luxury labels, department stores like Lane Crawford (and possibly the upcoming Beijing outpost of France\u2019s Galeries Lafayette), and more avant-garde chains like Dong Liang and Triple-Major.", "Tweet", "Follow @JingDaily ", "", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", ""]}, {"title": "Weibo 101: What One Chinese Brand Can Teach The Luxury Industry About Digital Marketing", "meta": "August 23, 2011", "paragraphs": ["One of IDo\u2019s free \u201cIrresistibly Appealing\u201d bracelets", "As major luxury brands intensify their efforts to use Sina Weibo as an effective digital marketing and communication tool, over the past \u00a0month an event by the Chinese jewelry brand \u201cIDo\u201d has presented a valuable case study in successfully targeting young, tech-savvy shoppers solely via Weibo, one that the Louis Vuittons and Burberrys of the world shouldn\u2019t ignore.", "A year and a half after creating its Weibo account, IDo now has more than 400,000 fans, most of whom started following the company in recent months. Initially, Hexun notes, like most brands IDo used its Weibo account primarily for displaying products and product information, then later established a Weibo forum with more in-depth content and two-way communications. At the end of last month, though, IDo launched its first Weibo promotional activity, \u201cIrresistibly\u00a0Appealing\u201d (\u5f53\u65f6\u6211\u52a8\u5fc3\u4e86, literally \u201cI was moved\u201d), taking advantage of consumer insights accrued over the past year via its Weibo forum.", "Currently ongoing, \u201cIrresistibly Appealing\u201d includes a daily lottery that gives fans the chance to win diamond rings and necklaces, and encourages fans to share their most romantic dreams, with IDo choosing one fan per week whose dream the company will make \u201ccome true.\u201d On the first week of the event, one fan was given the opportunity to meet actor and singer William Feng (\u51af\u7ecd\u5cf0), on week two a fan was given a luxury equestrian riding experience, and on the third week the chosen dream entailed a trip in a hot air balloon. As of this week, the event had attracted more than 100,000 participants and was shared by more than 80,000 Weibo users.", "Aside from the fact that it involves\u00a0online giveaways \u2014 always popular in China \u2014 one of the main reasons IDo\u2019s promotion is working is that it actually gets people into its stores. Recently, the company announced via Weibo and other social media that it would be giving away free bracelets at its store locations, giving those who signed up for an in-store raffle a chance to win a\u00a0diamond\u00a0ring. While the pink silicone bracelets aren\u2019t much to brag about, the announcement lit up Chinese social media platforms, and within three days IDo had given away tens of thousands of free bracelets, with the company announcing that it would have to produce several hundred thousand more. After giving away its first batch, IDo then encouraged Weibo fans to share photos of\u00a0themselves wearing their free bracelets and leave comments about \u201ctheir romantic dreams.\u201d Saccharine, yes.

Still, with brands like Hublot, Burberry, Louis Vuitton and Gucci looking to get more involved with Weibo this year, it\u2019s clear that the platform can\u2019t be ignored by anyone in the luxury industry, and cases like IDo\u2019s ongoing promotion indicate that microblogging campaigns done correctly can build buzz better and more quickly than any other online resource in China. While we\u2019d never expect to see brands like LV give away free bracelets, one needs only to look at the massive reaction on Weibo to the free Gucci folders included in the August issue of Vogue China to see how buzz can reach fever pitch (and drive sales).", "There are still risks, however, both to reputation and to the bottom line. While IDo\u2019s \u201cIrresistibly\u00a0Appealing\u201d event is, in Jing Daily\u2019s view at least, a success, one must consider that the company has already invested millions of yuan putting it on, and we have no sense of IDo\u2019s ROI as it currently stands. Nonetheless, over the past few months, IDo has succeeded in exciting its Weibo fans and spreading its name throughout the world of Chinese social media. While this kind of promotion isn\u2019t for every luxury brand, creative Weibo campaigns shouldn\u2019t be discounted, particularly by\u00a0younger or smaller brands that don\u2019t have the name recognition or clout of Chanel or Herm\u00e8s.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Jing Daily Q&A: JNBY, China\u2019s International Fashion Pioneer", "meta": "August 18, 2011", "paragraphs": ["JNBY currently has over 400 locations in China alone", "Since its inception in 1994, JNBY has sought to redefine what a home-grown Chinese fashion company can be and what it can accomplish.

However, JNBY has been operating in Canada for several years whereas we only launched in the U.S. a year and half ago, so the growth is proportionately the same.

With the popularity of French Bordeaux wine among Chinese wine drinkers, do you find this Bordeaux connection to be a major selling point for Silver Heights wines?", " ", "EG: Yes. Like other countries around the world, the Chinese tend to get to know wine through Bordeaux. Cabernet Sauvignon is grown all over China, but Ningxia gets 3,200 hours of annual sunshine, which is perfect for ripening Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. One of the reasons we\u2019ve gotten attention is because we\u2019re one of the few wineries in China to have just the right conditions to make a traditional Cabernet Sauvignon wine.", "Unlike Bordeaux\u2019s mild oceanic climate, where grapes have a longer growing period that makes for a more complex wine with a lingering aftertaste, Ningxia has an extreme continental climate. We\u2019re at an altitude of 1,200 meters with huge temperature shifts between day and night. During the winter, the grape vines are buried underground and the grapes have a shorter growing period. Usually, wine made under such conditions tastes less complex and has a shorter aftertaste. But the wine we make is full-bodied and spicy, with blackberry notes and hints of mineral.", "At the University of Bordeaux, I slowly digested everything I learned from my textbooks and put it into practice to try and make great wines. Luckily, the large vineyard my father used to manage provided me with high-quality grapes. ", "So if grapes are the father of our wines, the Bordeaux Berger oak barrels we use are the mother.

In Shandong [province, northeast China], they had a dry and cold winter, and the late spring caused a large number of grape vines to die off, particularly late-maturing varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Tannat. But  since we bury our vines in the winter in Xinjiang and Ningxia [in the west], our crops weren\u2019t really affected by the unusual weather.

Go to any high street in the world, and you\u2019ll find Chinese people shopping in luxury boutiques there. This spring, I was passing through Dubai International Airport, where all of the world\u2019s top luxury brands have stores, and I noticed Chinese shoppers all breathlessly saying the same thing, almost in unison: \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap!\u201d", "Chinese people spend a lot of money overseas, due to China\u2019s luxury tax. Because the government and the people have different\u00a0attitudes\u00a0towards luxury goods, this leads to stiff punitive taxes being levied against luxury items, so the number of Chinese people shopping domestically remains a drop in the potential bucket; But if you go overseas, you see Chinese people behaving completely differently, acting almost hysterically, toting bags large and small, often wiping out entire stores, leaving foreigners flabbergasted.", "As a result of the high prices of luxury goods [in China] and the insecure pursuit of these goods among some Chinese people, we\u2019re seeing societal polarization: One one side, you\u2019ve got people who can afford to buy luxury goods flaunting them openly, and on the other, you have the \u201chave-nots\u201d fostering a deep hatred of the \u201chaves\u201d.

Early on, the brand took inspiration from Europe and the European aesthetic of bicycles, and the rationale was to provide a semblance of freedom and the ability to enjoy the cities and communities that Chinese people lived in. The aesthetic, functionality and production has really remained unchanged from 1950 to now. The Flying Pigeon you\u2019re getting now from us is essentially the same Flying Pigeon you\u2019d have ridden in Tianjin or Shanghai or Beijing 60 years ago. ", "The Flying Pigeon really fits in to what\u2019s happening now in Vancouver in terms of fashion and culture. The city\u2019s really evolving into a bicycle city. People are starting to change the way they experience the city, and everything now is revolving around a slower means of transportation. Three of the four business partners in our company have lived in China, and we all had Flying Pigeons over there, so it\u2019s a natural extension for us to bring together these two cultures. And the bicycle fits so well with where Vancouver is going as a city, but really this goes for all cities, in terms of bike programs, bike lanes\u2026people are staring to understand how important it is to move towards a different way of living. A slower movement.", "Patrick Conn (PC): And Vancouver\u2019s demographics have a strong flavor of the East. Most of our population is made up of South Asians and [East] Asians, and with Vancouver moving more towards being a bike city, we thought this would be a good way to segue between the two cultures. Being on the Pacific Rim, Vancouver is often called the \u201cGateway to the Pacific\u201d, and that couples well with the bike culture that\u2019s growing here.", " ", "The brand's main design and typography has remained unchanged since the 1950s", "JD: What exactly was it about this brand that sparked your interest in bringing it to the North American market?", "PC: We wanted to evolve the idea of bringing Chinese brands to North America and branding them in a way that\u2019s representative of the traditional culture, but changed for this market. We like to use this term, \u201ctrans-creation\u201d, which is paying homage to the brand story but making it relevant to this market. We see our company being a gateway between the two markets, and the Flying Pigeon was the most relevant [brand] for what\u2019s culturally happening in Vancouver but also North America. So this idea of bringing the bike over made sense from a brand perspective but also culturally made sense, and was really indicative of what\u2019s happening here.", "BF: From a marketing perspective, also we get to be in control of a brand, which allows us to do everything we want to do without having to deal with a client. We\u2019re able to be free and truly creative, and we\u2019re really looking to tell a cohesive story.", "Plus, the bike has been organically branded. It\u2019s got a great deal of history and it\u2019s a gorgeous bicycle, so we\u2019re really just, as Patrick said, \u201ctrans-creating\u201d it for this market and trying to tell its story.", "PC: There are so many little bizarre things about the bike. Like when it first came out, it was Mao\u2019s goal for everybody to have three things: a Flying Pigeon, a sewing machine, and a pocket watch. Just those little things that are so unique to the culture and its ideals at the time.", "JD: China has several heritage bicycle brands from the same period as the Flying Pigeon, like Forever (\u6c38\u4e45) and Phoenix (\u51e4\u51f0). What drew you to Flying Pigeon? Was there something about the brand itself that attracted you to it?", "PC: I think it has the most unique story, and that storytelling is the most powerful part for us. Looking among the three [bike brands], there are similarities visually but, aesthetically, I think Flying Pigeon is the best out of the three, and when you look at its typography, the badge on the front, it\u2019s almost like something that could be in an art installation. It aligns so well with the way culture and fashion are going here. ", "BF: And it was the first of the three, so it\u2019s got the most history. Plus, the name isn\u2019t something you\u2019d ever forget. It\u2019s almost bizarre, but it\u2019s a great name.", " ", "JD: Several \u201cretro\u201d Chinese brands have been revived in recent years, often by Westerners. I\u2019m curious about how you look at the idea of a niche market being formed in North America for retro brands that are distinctly Chinese.", "PC: The most interesting part of this is the perception of \u201cMade in China\u201d. The interesting thing about this whole process is how we can change and shift people\u2019s perception of brands from China through effective communications. I think the shift is already taking place, and that\u2019s a powerful thing for us to be part of now. It\u2019s very niche, but our strategy to get in with a certain type of buyer is, at the beginning, about getting in with an influencer, someone who respects and understands culture, fashion and art. ", "BF: Plus, as the Chinese become wealthier a lot of them are leaving China, and later they often like to associate themselves with the country they come from. So they see these retro brands are cool again and enjoy seeing something made in China or derived from China elsewhere in the world.", "JD: Yeah, we recently spoke with Ben Walters of Ospop who uses the tag line \u201cProudly Made in China\u201d, it\u2019s a similar idea.", "PC: Right there on the bike\u2019s top bar, you see it every time you mount the bike, it says \u201cMade in China\u201d. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not hidden, it\u2019s not on the underside of the crank.", "BF: And it\u2019s important for people in North America to see it\u2019s a beautiful and timeless piece of machinery. It\u2019s been part of the fabric of China for 60 years and that shifts the whole idea and consumer perspective of what\u2019s happening in China.", "JD: Which Flying Pigeon models are you bringing to the North American market, and are you tailoring them to consumer preferences there at all?", "BF: We\u2019re bringing the original two models. There\u2019s the PA-02, the male version with the single top bar. There was an option with a double top bar, which was originally commissioned by Mao, that could handle the weight of a pig, so you could carry a pig to market. But we opted for the single bar for weight and cost savings. Then there\u2019s the female step-through version with the skirt guard and a more elegant aesthetic. A more Dutch style.", "We upgraded both of these with cable brakes, and upgraded the pedals, tires, wheels, seats, handlebars and grips. We sourced these parts from Flying Pigeon\u2019s more modern bike models for functionality and safety. Vancouver\u2019s not a hilly city by any means, but we wanted to make sure the brakes could handle hills.", "PC: It\u2019s been customized to a degree for North America, because rod brakes might work for China, where it\u2019s relatively flat, but we have to be cognizant that we could potentially ship these bikes to cities that have all kinds of different conditions.", " ", "The classic Flying Pigeon in Vancouver", "JD: Who\u2019s your target market in North America?", "PC: A younger creative class, mostly, but people who are culturally aware, whether that\u2019s in terms of art, fashion or business. They\u2019re very much their own individuals, often well traveled, educated. But that being said it kind of transcends age group. We can imagine seeing a guy on a Flying Pigeon who\u2019s 75 years old or it could be an 18-year-old who\u2019s using it to get to his or her first job.", "BF: We\u2019ve also had interest from wealthy empty-nest boomer-type guys. One was a former stockbroker who fell in love with the Flying Pigeon and ordered four of them for his whole family. We aim at certain demographics but it\u2019s tough to put a finger on it.", "JD: What price range are you shooting for, and where will you sell the bikes in North America?", "BF: The push is going to be on the online store we\u2019re creating, and we have a pop-up store in Vancouver, in a neighborhood called Gastown. It\u2019s kind of the cultural hub of Vancouver. The price point we\u2019re shooting for is $475. We want it to be under $500. There are obviously some headaches dealing with the Chinese and Canadian governments, lots of taxation involved with bringing bikes in from China. So that price point is what\u2019s feasible.", "PC: Canada is probably literally the worst place to bring a bike from China into. So we\u2019re doing a limited release to get a sense of the market and demand from outside of Vancouver. It\u2019s a phased approach right now, which is all driven online. We\u2019ve been in talks with retailers who could move us into the US market, but the issue is importation and the differences in costs and duties. The idea is to find the most efficient way to get the bikes into the U.S. without having to have them come through Canada.", " ", "Detail of the Flying Pigeon PA-02", "JD: How do you plan to promote the brand? Are you sticking to a fully digital strategy, organizing special events, or planning something else?", "PC: We\u2019re going fully digital. The essence of our strategy is to create content that\u2019s spreadable and tells the story in a unique way. That involves everything from video to contesting to photography, so we\u2019re bringing the right team in to take what we\u2019re trying to do to another level. ", "BF: And another thing is that it\u2019s got to be authentic. Although we\u2019re leveraging people with a lot of online influence, everything we do with these people has to be authentic, and that\u2019s an issue for them as well. They have their own personal brand, and there needs to be synergy between the two. When everything clicks and makes sense in terms of brands and collaborators, it makes spreadability that much easier.", "JD: So when is the official launch?", "BF: The formal launch will be in just over a week, but the retail pop-up will launch next week, and the initial load of bikes will arrive within the next five days. The contesting, video and really the entire online rollout will take place in the next week and a half.", "JD: Is there anything else about the Flying Pigeon that you\u2019d like Jing Daily readers to know?", "PC: The most interesting thing with projects like this is the power of branding to shift perceptions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re most fascinated by.

But this week, the Chinese news source claims that some Prada buyers in China have lodged complaints about products they\u2019ve purchased from the label, in a story that reflects the fact that some luxury buyers in China are less educated about things like post-sale service and maintenance. (Yet these shoppers are sometimes quick to appeal to the press, a fact of which luxury brands need to be mindful.)", "From the article (translation by Jing Daily team):", "Chinese shopper Lily Qin bought a Prada bag earlier this year in Frankfurt, Germany.

This is particularly true for a very public label like Prada, which is pinning much of its strategy on China at the moment. As Jing Daily has previously noted, in addition to its store expansion in China, Prada plans to open a design studio in Hong Kong later this year, and hopefully the label will boost its after-sales service and after-sales service education in China as well.

According to a company release, Since this February, seven major brands have launched exclusive video channels on Youku, joining other labels like Dior, Gucci and Omega.", "Interestingly enough, Louis Vuitton was one of the first brands to experiment with Youku, launching video ads in 2009 and a full branded channel in 2010. Within the last year, possibly emboldened by the views LV\u2019s videos were getting, other brands like\u00a0Guerlain, Cartier and Longines launched their own channels, and in the first half of this year, Burberry streamed a live webcast of its Milan Fashion Show on Youku, helping its official channel reach over one million views.

The \u201coverlap\u201d in the luxury consumer base and the user demographics of video sites like Youku, which are similarly youthful, means they\u2019re a marketing tool that\u2019s difficult to ignore. As Youku SVP, Frank Ming Wei, added, increasing their presence on video sites like Youku is a good strategy for luxury brands to reach consumers in more far-flung interior regions.

The curious question, however, is whether these efforts are actually paying off in terms of sales. While LV\u2019s tie-up with Jiepang was by most accounts a success, this success was partly due to the fact that many\u00a0Jiepang users simply wanted to display the free virtual LV badge on their profiles. This, of course, is something of a marketing success but if it doesn\u2019t influence actual sales, it\u2019s essentially a fun little gimmick. That said, it\u2019s a very important space to watch, and if brands start to use Jiepang or other services to offer special promotions, we could theoretically see a significant sales bump.", "Now, as more brands launch exclusive channels on video sites like Youku and go beyond simply posting in-video advertisements, we still have several questions: How will brands best use this platform to actually entice viewers to buy?

In the past, people might have asked why we spend money on Starbucks rather than just making coffee at home. Similarly, why go out to eat on Chinese New Year rather than cooking at home? In today\u2019s society, people\u2019s lifestyles have changed.

Looking beyond the headlines and bombast, ArtTactic\u2019s new study \u2014 available in English and Chinese at the ART HK VIP lounge or online \u2014 turns an objective eye to overall trends, analyzes recent auctions, tracks art market confidence, profiles China\u2019s key blue-chip artists, sets out art market models, and (perhaps most importantly to Chinese collectors) includes a list of collector tips.", "After a note by ArtTactic founder and managing director, Anders Petterson, the report kicks off with a brief introduction to the Chinese contemporary art world, including a detailed timeline that tracks its inception and development in the late 1970s, through the 1980s and \u201990s and into its first boom in the mid-2000s. Next, the report looks specifically at the second boom of Chinese contemporary art in 2010. \u201cWhilst most global art markets were experiencing a significant value correction and a dramatic decrease in auction volumes in 2009,\u201d the report notes, \u201cthe Chinese art market was not affected, in fact, Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong sales in 2009 drummed up the second highest total ever, and set the scene for a dramatic boom in 2010.\u201d", "Tracing the dramatic growth seen by domestic Chinese auction houses last year vis-\u00e0-vis Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s Hong Kong, the report tempers its optimism by pointing out that the risk of speculation in the mainland China market \u201cis a threat that cannot be ignored\u201d and that non-payment in the auction market is \u201cof great concern.\u201d", "Yang Fudong tops the artist confidence chart (Image: ArtTactic)", "Looking next to the increasingly competitive art fair landscape, which has pitted Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai against each other in a fight for supremacy, ArtTactic\u2019s report points out that 250 galleries are taking part in ART HK 2011, up from 155 last year, a figure that places the fair among the top five worldwide. What does this mean for the Chinese art market? For ART HK, it indicates that a healthy primary art market is developing in the region. As the fair has \u201cestablished itself as the main international gateway to the Chinese and Asian primary market, as well as an important conduit for Chinese buyers to engage in non-Asian contemporary art,\u201d ArtTactic expects ART HK \u2014 now 60 percent owned by Art Basel \u2014 to become the most important contemporary art fair in Asia.", "Turning to China\u2019s major museum-building push and its increasing ranks of new Chinese collectors, ArtTactic points out that China had 3,020 museums as of 2009, with 100 new museums added every year, and the country now boasts 328 private museums. Listing some of China\u2019s most important museums, along with some of the world\u2019s most important Chinese contemporary art collectors, the report then explains how Chinese and Indonesian collectors have recently emerged as some of the most important supporters of Chinese contemporary art. This is a sea-change from the market of only a decade ago, when Western super-collectors were some of the most enthusiastic buyers of this art segment. \u201cWhilst the first cycle (1990-2005) of the Chinese contemporary art market was largely driven by demand and interest from Western collectors, such as Uli Sigg and Guy Ullens,\u201d the report notes, \u201cthe boom market between 2005-2008 was largely driven by Asian demand.\u201d", "Chinese contemporary art has come back strong from the downturn in 2008 (Image: ArtTactic)", "Interestingly, \u201csince the downturn in 2008,\u201d ArtTactic notes, \u201cTaiwanese collectors have emerged as one of the most powerful collector groups in the Chinese contemporary art market.\u201d 71 percent of respondents told ArtTactic that they believe Taiwanese collectors have the largest impact on the Chinese contemporary art market at the moment. However, mainland Chinese collectors rank in the top five, ahead of US and Indonesian collectors.", "This debunks recent perceptions that Chinese collectors were only interested in traditional art and validates observations by Jing Daily and others who have kept a close eye on the trend of growing interest in contemporary art among mainland Chinese buyers.", "After pointing out that China overtook the UK last year for the first time to become the world\u2019s second largest art market after the US, ArtTactic charts last year\u2019s dramatic 271 percent rise in the domestic Chinese art market, which outstripped Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong sales for the first time ever by a margin of 19 percent. Incisively noting the differing tastes seen among buyers in the Hong Kong and mainland China markets (a critical observation), ArtTactic writes that contemporary themes and conceptual practices accounted for 64 percent of Hong Kong lots last year. In mainland China, by comparison, 57 percent of lots were more traditional in style.", "Reiterating its previous finding that the Chinese\u00a0contemporary\u00a0art market is now the most confident in the world, ArtTactic then moves on to an important factor at play in the market \u2014 risk. Asking whether the current Chinese contemporary art boom is an asset bubble or marks a \u201cmajor shift in consumption of art as a luxury good,\u201d the report concludes that the former is likely the case. Findings demonstrate that there are serious differences between the international Chinese contemporary art market and the mainland Chinese contemporary market. This backs up ArtTactic\u2019s contention that the Chinese contemporary art market is on a two-track journey driven by \u201cdifferent market dynamics and different types of buyers.\u201d What does this mean, exactly? It means that risk in the mainland China market \u2014 where domestic auction houses often champion artists not preferred by the international market, and hot money is more of an issue \u2014 is 49 percent higher than in the international market (which, at 4.1, is 16 percent lower than in September 2010). This, ArtTactic feels, is\u00a0indicative\u00a0that a speculative bubble may be forming in the mainland China market.", "Liu Xiaodong\u2019s rising confidence indicator (Image: ArtTactic)", "Looking at art market confidence for some of China\u2019s top artists, ArtTactic finds positive momentum for several blue-chip artists \u2014 some of whom are popular in the mainland China as well as international markets.

Ma Huateng (\u9a6c\u5316\u817e), the 39-year old founder and CEO of Shenzhen-based Tencent, one of China\u2019s largest and most popular Internet service portals, ranks at the top of the list with a fortune of 32 billion yuan ($4.9 billion).

Among those who inherited fortunes or estates, Yang Huiyan tops the list. However, as the Hurun Report conceded, it\u2019s very difficult to accurately calculate the fortunes inherited (or due to be inherited) by China\u2019s so-called \u201crich second generation\u201d (\u5bcc\u4e8c\u4ee3).", "Hurun Report chairman and chief researcher Rupert Hoogewerf suggested that wealthy young Chinese are better educated, more promising and more cosmopolitan than their forebears. Almost everyone on the list graduated from college, with nearly 20 percent holding a master\u2019s degree or higher. In terms of the regional distribution of the young rich, Guangdong Province heads up the list, with 11 people. Shanghai ranks second, followed by Zhejiang Province.

More notable this year, the number of wealthy Chinese choosing to educate their children in Switzerland has increased significantly. Although many Chinese parents have sent their children to study in\u00a0Australia\u00a0in recent decades, the number of wealthy and ultra-wealthy Chinese choosing to do so has declined. Additionally, the survey found that most young multi-millionaires and\u00a0billionaires are more inclined to send their children to study abroad at a younger age, for high school or even primary education.", "Compared with the \u201crich first generation,\u201d the rich second generation is more international in terms of educational background and vision. In terms of majors, 60 percent of people are more interested in business-related majors like finance, international trade and business administration, followed by science, arts and engineering. Unsurprisingly, the Hurun Report found that the rich second generation is not only more global than their parents, they\u2019re also much more fashionable. They\u2019re more\u00a0aware\u00a0of luxury brands and the high-end lifestyle than their parents due to a wide range of information channels, including the Internet and friends, as well as their experience studying and living abroad. According to survey findings, the living standard of the rich second generation is significantly higher than ordinary white-collar workers in China, with nearly 20 percent of them spending 20,000 yuan ($3,074) per month, of which business related expenses account for almost 40 percent.", "More than half of the rich second generation are passionate about creating their own businesses, with those from Guangdong Province displaying a distinct entrepreneurial streak. Guangdong respondents overwhelmingly said they prefer creative industries over traditional industries, and are interested in investing in industries like IT, trade and textiles. In terms of fundraising, the Hurun Report found that most young entrepreneurs generally get initial start-up capital, usually anywhere from 500,000-1 million yuan (US$76,900-154,000), from friends. // \n(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" mce_src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&amp;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()\n// ]]&gt;"]}, {"title": "Gucci\u2019s Low-Key Return To Guangzhou: Missed Opportunity?

Maybe Gucci\u2019s strategy of leaving Guangzhou and coming back in a low-key fashion seven years later is a form of very slow marketing. Of course, Guangzhou shoppers are already very familiar with Gucci, so maybe we don\u2019t need a lot of pomp and circumstance \u2014 we\u2019ll make our way to the new Gucci store on our own.", "Still, many are disappointed in Gucci\u2019s quiet return to Guangzhou, thinking that the brand missed an excellent promotional opportunity. At the end of this month, Hermes will hold an event for the debut of its store expansion in Guangzhou, and many other brands are eager to have a go at this market, including Chanel, which is planning to open its first location in China\u2019s southwest region in Guangzhou. According to a PR rep from Chanel, the company will begin a market research effort to test out the market in Guangzhou this June. What\u2019s more important for the Guangzhou luxury scene is that Taikoo Hui [shopping mall] will finally open in Guangzhou within the next two years, which will bring with it plenty of flagship stores. ", "This story brings up interesting questions that many luxury brands undoubtedly grapple with in relatively developed Chinese cities like Guangzhou. Is it better to save your lavish grand opening celebrations for younger, more rapidly growing markets in inland China, such as Chongqing or Kunming, where consumers are less brand-savvy and will be more easily wowed by celebrity appearances? Is the low-key launch (or re-launch, in the case of Gucci in Guangzhou) better for top-tier cities, or is it simply too risky? Clearly, Gucci is formulating an expansion strategy in China that puts it at odds with brands like Burberry, which recently held an extravagant blowout to celebrate its new Beijing flagship, and Diane Von Furstenberg, who held an arguably more over-the-top Red Ball in Shanghai. Who\u2019s got the right idea? That\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess at this point.", "However, as the Yangcheng Evening News article conceded, maybe Gucci doesn\u2019t need to bother with blowout parties anymore. Gucci\u2019s name recognition in a city like Guangzhou means that, no matter how loudly or quietly its relaunch, wealthy Guangzhounese will still head to the store with wallets in hand.", "Tweet", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", ""]}, {"title": "Week In Review: April 25-29", "meta": "April 29, 2011", "paragraphs": ["In case you missed them the first time around, here are some of Jing Daily\u2019s top posts for the week of April 25-29:", "Mary Ching", "Interview: Alison Mary Ching Yeung, Creative Director of Mary Ching Footwear", "With the world\u2019s attention on the booming mega-cities of China, Chinese fashion brands are quickly stepping into the spotlight.

Many of the ingredients featured in your dishes are less common in Chinese cuisine. How much education or adaptation do you foresee for the Chinese market? At least for the Chinese palate. ", "Chef Julie Donohoe: I think the Chinese are becoming a lot more adventurous and want to try different things. I\u2019ve only been here 12 months but already I can see they want to. If I do a set menu like this for you \u2013 you might not order it otherwise, but if you try it with all the different flavors, you go, \u201cOh, actually, I was a bit scared at first but now that I\u2019ve tried it, I really like it.\u201d So I think it\u2019s just trying to encourage local diners, which we\u2019re doing a lot of set menus, where I\u2019m trying to use things that they may not be used to, to understand, and to help them to taste the flavors. ", "JD: I mean, you use a lot of sweet flavors, a lot of salty-sweet, fruits\u2026", "Julie: Yeah, I have a little bit of an Asian-cooking background. In Australia, we always do a lot of fusion food. So I\u2019m used to trying to do this with the food at CHAR, like the cod sauce with currants.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: Yeah, I really enjoyed that. So what\u2019s the idea behind the paintbrush thing? To get people involved?", "Julie: Just to make it a little more fun, yeah. Also, the idea is that you can put as little or as much sauce as you\u2019d like. ", "JD: What are some differences in dining culture between Westerners and Chinese? There\u2019s obviously an emphasis on service and atmosphere here, but did you do anything special to cater to Chinese guests? ", "Julie: I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research on trying different tasting menus, and we actually have about six different types of set menus. So again, to make Chinese guests feel more comfortable, there are differently priced menus, ranging from 400 RMB to 1,800 RMB (US$61-$277). So depending if they want to spend a lot of money on their family and friends or [not], I match the food together and Ethan will match the wine. They can come in and just sit down, not have to think, we just look after them. I think this is probably more their style. ", "Also the sharing, there\u2019s a little more sharing, instead of just a la carte. Again this is something Chinese customers are accustomed to, and feel a bit more comfortable with. ", "JD: Alright, Ethan, wine culture is becoming bigger and bigger in China, so of course, you have an extensive wine list. Is it curated for a Chinese palette? Is there a difference between Chinese and Western tastes in wine?", "", "Ethan Tian, Food and Beverage Director: I think there is, because there\u2019s scientific research [that] says the Asian palette is more sensitive than the Western palette. And also, I think wine is quite new to China and actually wine drinkers [here] like something more fruity and sweet to drink. The first time we did a blind tasting with 15 students, we had French Bordeaux and Burgundy, Australian wines\u2026but didn\u2019t tell them what was what. And actually, French wine came behind, with all of the New World wines coming first. A week later, they did another tasting, and at this one we told them which one was French, which one was Australian. This time, the French one came first. Exact same people, exact same wine. ", "So here, it\u2019s more about mentality, Asian people sometimes like branding, so French wines, Bordeaux, Burgundy, should be top ones. But what I found out is that people enjoy drinking New World wines more, so that\u2019s why our wine list is more focused on Australia, New Zealand, or even Chile. Also, now Bordeaux has become something to buy and sell, like the stock market, it\u2019s not really for you to enjoy. Like last year, we were lucky to taste a bottle of 1959 Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion. It was stunning, but it cost 10,000 euros.", "Julie: You wouldn\u2019t be ordering that every week, would you.", "Ethan: It\u2019s good, but is it worth 10,000 euros? I don\u2019t think so. As Chinese people get more and more interested in wine, we\u2019re telling them,\u00a0believe\u00a0in yourself and trust in your own palette. Don\u2019t just believe in brand and price.", "", "JD: What do you think of Chinese wines? Are there any you like? ", "Ethan: We just attended a Chinese wine tasting the other day, with a boutique winery called Jade Valley.\u00a0Julie\u2019s going to be there this September. They produce Cabernet\u00a0Sauvignon and\u00a0Pinot Noir, and the owner is Qingyun Ma, a very famous architect. The first I\u2019d heard of the winery was when Jancis Robinson (Ed. note: British wine critic) was quoted in a magazine as saying, \u201cI just tasted this very interesting Pinot Noir from China called Jade Valley.\u201d I was like, Pinot from China? My mind was blown. ", "We were very lucky to meet the owner and the winemaker and actually taste the wine, and I put their Cabernet\u00a0Sauvignon\u00a0on our wine list. There are pretty good quality Chinese wines, especially from small, boutique wineries coming up, they just need a bit of time. ", "Julie: And I think too, like you were saying, they\u2019ve got a Californian winemaker behind them, teaching them how to make it, to the level that everyone\u2019s used to. This makes sense, then, that it\u2019s a style everyone is accustomed to and will find acceptable.", "Ethan: It\u2019s all about experience. You really have to know your game, it\u2019s not just something you can just pick up. It really takes time. I think [China\u2019s] getting there. I just visited Tasmania, Australia, two weeks ago, and visited a very famous winemaker who consults a winery in China, and he said that within the next 20-30 years, China\u2019s going to become a more [respected] winemaking country.

Do you see that kind of culture picking up in China? What\u2019s CHAR\u2019s signature drink?", "Ethan: Our main signature drink is\u00a0the Char Tonic. It\u2019s Aperol \u2014 sort of like Campari\u2019s little sister \u2014 with a little bit of vermouth, Amaro, grapefruit, and a little bit of Tanqueray and tonic water. It\u2019s very refreshing.

They do have pretty nice cocktails. ", "Ethan: Yes, but I still think my favorite cocktail lounge in Shanghai is probably ours. The drinks are both classic and delicious.

", "JD: Is that something you\u2019re aiming for, to bring in more local Chinese? Or are you focusing on the foreign market? ", "Julie: Yep, very much the Chinese market. ", "Ethan: Just from a business perspective, I think they\u2019re your bread and butter, the Chinese. If you want to survive, as a restaurant, you need to get Chinese coming in, to really appreciate what you\u2019re doing. ", "Julie: I think so. We talked a lot about this, how to make locals feel welcome and relaxed and not think, \u201cthis place is Western, it\u2019s full of expats, I don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d So yeah, I think this has been really important for us.

(Laughs)", "JD: So what is CHAR doing by way of marketing right now, inviting media?", "Julie: Yes. A lot of media, a lot of mini-launch parties. To be honest, a lot of word-of-mouth. For the three months that we were in soft opening, we hosted a lot of functions, so we welcomed many groups of people who are coming back now that we\u2019re open. We\u2019ve had people, who after seeing us on a few media sources and blogs, come in to have a look. They want to see what it is. And again, we\u2019re trying to really market ourselves not as a hotel restaurant but a stand-alone restaurant that happens to be on top of a hotel. We really want to try to get that out there, since people often make the association \u2014 hotel restaurant, expensive. We\u2019re different, so we\u2019re trying not to connect the two if we can. ", "JD: Are you guys using any new media, social media?", "Julie: A lot of social media, yes.\u00a0We\u2019ve shown up on [local blogs like] EnjoyShanghai, SmartShanghai and others.", "Ethan: In terms of social media, we\u2019re going to get more involved on Facebook and more importantly, on Sina Weibo, the Chinese Twitter.

Since pairing up with Dr. McGovern in the late 1990s after an introduction from the late beer writer\u00a0Michael Jackson, Dogfish Head has developed two ancient ales in addition to Midas Touch: Theobroma and Chateau Jiahu. Discussing his 15-year-old company\u2019s interest in resurrecting ancient brews, Calagione said he\u2019s always found it interesting that the two most common items found by archaeologists at ancient gravesites are remnants of food and some form of alcohol.", "Discussing the process of \u201ccloning\u201d ancient beers found at archaeological sites, Calagione pointed out that the molecular analysis performed on pottery shards by Dr. McGovern produces only a list of ingredients, rather than a precise recipe, so the Dogfish brewing team \u201ctakes some liberties\u201d with the final brew. For example, ancient brewers, unaware of the existence of yeast, would have relied on wild yeasts for fermentation, and the final \u201cbeers\u201d would likely have been consumed only days after the beginning of fermentation. Since this type of brewing is far too unpredictable \u2014 and the end results would likely be unpalatable for modern drinkers \u2014 re-creating beers like Midas Touch meant some tactical brewing decisions on the part of Dogfish Head.

Made with cacao nibs and powder, ancho chiles, honey, barley and annatto seed, Theobroma is rich and complex. Next, to switch the evening up a bit, came Palo Santo \u2014 not an Ancient Ale, but a 12% alcohol pitch-black ale brewed in barrels made from Paraguayan palo santo (\u201choly stick\u201d) wood, one of the world\u2019s heaviest and densest woods, the resins of which impart an unusual but spellbinding aftertaste that linger on the tongue long after the last sip.

Based on chemical analysis of resins discovered in the 1960s at a 9,000-year-old Neolithic tomb at Jiahu, China (modern-day Wuyang, Henan province), Chateau Jiahu is a reinterpretation of the oldest non-grape-based fermented beverage ever discovered by archaeologists. The beer includes hawthorn berries, grapes, honey, chrysanthemum flowers and sake yeast, the end result being a relatively light (for a 9% alcohol beverage), nicely carbonated beer with the slightest hint of fruit. The perfect segue to Dr. Agnes Hsu\u2019s presentation on the Jiahu archaeological site and its importance in the field of Neolithic studies.", "Hsu began by pointing out that the Jiahu site is a key archaeological find for more than one reason. Besides evidence of the aforementioned fermented beverage, the tomb at Jiahu \u2014 located between Beijing and Shanghai, on the Yellow River in what is now Henan province \u2014 also held the first musical instrument ever discovered by archaeologists. This, Hsu said, means the 9,000-year-old site indicates the first stirrings of the \u201cNeolithic Revolution\u201d in the Far East, when humans made the transition from hunting and gathering to forming agrarian\u00a0societies\u00a0with division of labor, agricultural cultivation, language, and personal possessions. Also, the extinct form of rice found at Jiahu makes this one of the earliest (and most northern) sites in the world with evidence of rice cultivation, and the \u201cproto-grape\u201d used in the beer-like substance indicates either a cultivation of this fruit at Jiahu or some form of trade.", "Other interesting findings at Jiahu, and what ties this all back to Dogfish Head\u2019s Chateau Jiahu ale, are the musical instruments found at the site. Made from crane bones, the presence of these early flutes indicate the importance of music, as well as early alcoholic beverages, in the social lives of ancient humans. By reimagining and resurrecting Chateau Jiahu, Theobroma and Midas Touch, Dogfish Head looks to not only make a refreshing and unique product, but one that reminds us that the act of enjoying a drink among friends and loved ones is a universal act, one that that stretches back thousands of years and speaks to the fundamental elements that make us all human.", "The second installment of the China Institute\u2019s \u201cArchaeology of Beers\u201d series, featuring Dr. Patrick McGovern, will take place on Friday, December 17 from 6 \u2013 8 PM.

Additionally, each bottle of Red Diamond will have a unique serial number, and will be packaged in special boxes that feature locks that buyers can open only after calling a dedicated hotline to retrieve the password. While this sounds more Mission Impossible than Cheers, according to Moutai it is necessary to ensure the product\u2019s authenticity \u2014 something that China\u2019s high rollers are often more than willing to pay for,\u00a0particularly\u00a0in the wake of recent food and drink safety scandals.", "While this story seems like another case of a Chinese company releasing an astronomically priced product for the sake of publicity, it is actually a pretty important area to keep an eye on.

Also in attendance were the district vice mayor and representatives of Nike and HSBC, among others.", "At the unveiling, speeches were delivered by four individuals who have been key to the creation and development of the Shang Xia brand: Jiang Qiong Er (Shang Xia\u2019s artistic director), Herm\u00e8s\u00a0CEO Patrick Thomas, Japanese architect Kento Kuma (who designed Shang Xia\u2019s first boutique), and fashion photographer Paolo Roversi.", "Shang Xia CEO and chief designer Jiang Qiong Er", "Beginning the event, Jiang Qiong Er said that she has dreamt of building a brand like Shang Xia for 10 years, with the company itself being three years in the making. More than being just another brand, Jiang said she sees Shang Xia as a life philosophy. The name \u201cShang Xia\u201d (\u201cUp Down\u201d in Mandarin) was chosen to express two opposing forces or sides \u2014 yin and yang, extraordinary and ordinary \u2014 that come together to strike a harmonious balance. Jiang went on to say that Shang Xia is an organic brand, which Herm\u00e8s viewed as a seed, rather than just an acquisition, that it needed to nurture and help grow. So what made Herm\u00e8s look to China in the first place? As Jiang pointed out, not only is China a great candidate for business and expansion, but Herm\u00e8s found the country\u2019s long history of craftsmanship irresistable.", "After Jiang\u2019s speech, Patrick Thomas, the CEO of Herm\u00e8s, gave further details about Shang Xia\u2019s philosophy and design. Shang Xia, Thomas said, is not a second line of Herm\u00e8s, nor is it a copy designed for China. In terms of craftsmanship and creativity, Shang Xia is on par with Herm\u00e8s, yet everything else is different. For the past three years, 20-30 people have been working on Shang Xia, with production completely localized rather than done in Europe. This, Thomas pointed out, is a way of supporting the local culture as well as traditional Chinese arts like weaving and porcelain making.", "Hermes CEO Patrick Thomas", "Thomas went on to add that we will not be seeing Shang Xia products sold at Herm\u00e8s boutiques, or vice versa. Shang Xia is a wholly separate first line, which the company hopes to see expanding beyond the borders of China over time. Interestingly, Thomas said that the second Shang Xia boutique could open in France. Prior to the launch, the rumor was that the second store would be located in Beijing.", "Kento Kuma, the Japanese architect who designed Shang Xia\u2019s debut boutique, spoke next, remarking on the impression that Chinese craftsmanship has made on his work. Kuma said that his choice to sign on for the Shang Xia project was greatly influenced by his appreciation of Jiang Qiong Er\u2019s vision of old-meets-new, and of modernized tradition. Kuma said that he, like Shang Xia, hopes to promote Asian values in his work.", "Wrapping up the speeches, photographer Paolo Roversi said that Shang Xia represents more than just craftsmanship but also \u201csoul and love.\u201d Decked out in a Shang Xia outfit, Roversi said he is confident that the company will break through barriers and become a truly international brand.", "Next came the unveiling of some of Shang Xia\u2019s products, which have been kept under tight wraps over the past year. First came a small zitan wood stool by Master Gu, the smallest piece from the Da Tian Di (\u5927\u5929\u5730, \u201cBig Sky Ground\u201d) furniture series. This particular piece has perfectly squared edges with a rounded recess (which we find to be the trademark of Shang Xia) in the center. After being finished with sandpaper with a grit finer than toothpaste, the surface of this piece is as smooth as silk.", "The next Shang Xia item displayed was a traditional Chinese robe. Made of cashmere felt, the robe is created from a single piece of fabric with no cutting, and is completely hand-crafted \u2014 almost, as Jiang Qiong Er pointed out, like sculpting a piece of clothing. Warm and comfortable with a silky smooth touch, this piece was created by two sisters from Mongolia.", "Jiang Qiong Er displays a zitan piece from the Da Tian Di collection", "A unique ceramic and bamboo tea pot was then shown. Fired in 1380 degree Celsius heat to produce a pure, translucent white finish, the tea pot is then wrapped in .05mm thick bamboo weaving. Taking 10 days per pot to weave, the bamboo covering \u2014 woven by bamboo master Zhang \u2014 is, incredibly, free of joints, with the beginning and end of the bamboo strands completely imperceptible.", "Finally, Jiang Qiong Er displayed fine eggshell porcelain b0wls made by Master Lu from Jiangxi province, which measure only 2mm at their thickest point and, after careful sanding and shaving, only 0.5 mm at their thinnest. Perhaps more important to the design of these porcelain bowls, however, is the sound they make. So perfect in thickness and shape are they that each bowl has a distinct ring, which resonates evenly throughout the bowl.", "Attendees were then treated to a breathtaking video of the Chinese composer Dou Wei giving a performance using different sized Shang Xia porcelain bowls as instruments.", "Following the media event at One Xintiandi, attendees got a first look at the debut Shang Xia boutique at Hong Kong New World Plaza (\u9999\u6e2f\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\u5e7f\u573a). Kento Kuma\u2019s design evokes the feel of an ice cave, with Shang Xia\u2019s full range of furniture, home decorations, clothing and porcelain displayed on bamboo shelves and wall racks. Pricing for most items is reasonable by luxury standards, considering the craftsmanship of the products and top quality of the materials used in their design, with sweaters retailing for 2125 yuan (US$316), jackets around 7400 yuan ($1,105) and shoes around 2200 yuan ($327).", "The Jing Daily team would like to thank Angela Hua and Jiang Qiong Er of Shang Xia and Patrick Thomas of Herm\u00e8s for staging this exciting and important event.

Additionally, Royal Cake\u2018s \u201cclassic tribute\u201d mooncake gift box went on sale for 688 yuan ($101), with this reporter finding that the fillings included abalone, shark fin, French-style foie gras, top-quality bird\u2019s nest,\u00a0caterpillar\u00a0fungus and other highly expensive ingredients.", "As a worker at Royal Cake told me, \u201chigh-end fillings like abalone and shark fin were introduced this year in order to address the demand for high-quality ingredients and occupy that market niche.\u201d", "\u2026", "It\u2019s been reported that the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments released a joint announcement this July that looks to set better standards for the pricing, quality control, packaging and bundling of mooncakes. These standards would require manufacturers to cut down on excessive packaging and make sure the retail price of the gift boxes isn\u2019t significantly more than the cakes themselves. After repeated demands by the Chinese government for manufacturers to halt excessive packaging, the question of how to capture more high-end mooncake market share is a question that all of the country\u2019s heavyweights must face.", "Insider analysis has found that there are two reasons why we\u2019re seeing more high-end mooncakes being released this year: the first is greater consumer demand, and the second is the formal implementation of the restrictions on mooncake packaging. Since excessive luxury packaging of high-end mooncakes will be greatly restricted this year \u2014 and profit margins will be squeezed \u2014 many companies will fill mooncakes with ingredients like abalone, bird\u2019s nest, shark fin and other delicacies in order to dramatically raise the retail price of their products and maintain higher profits.", "\u201cI have no way of knowing whether you've got real ingredients, so how can I know whether you'll be delicious?\" (Image via Southern Daily)", "Although more manufacturers\u00a0are introducing delicacy-packed mooncakes into their product lines this year, as the article \u2014 and several others \u2014 goes on to point out, no formal standards currently exist in China stipulating the amount of a given ingredient manufacturers need to use in order to market their mooncake as \u201chigh-end.\u201d This, naturally, bothers some consumers:", "\u201cHow much abalone does a mooncake have to have in order to call itself \u2018abalone mooncake\u2019?\u201d asked Ms. Liu Xiaodong, who went on to say that high-end mooncakes cost far more than run-of-the-mill mooncakes but there\u2019s no guarantee that the materials used are actually high-quality.

This is unclear.", "Ms. Liu added that she thinks high-end mooncakes aren\u2019t worth the money in the end, because the price isn\u2019t in line with the cost of the raw materials and is unrealistically inflated.", "How much abalone, shark fin, bird\u2019s nest and other ingredients are used in a mooncake?

However, these standards are lax and unclear towards the specific amount of a given ingredient that must be used in a mooncake.", "If demand for these high-priced mooncakes continues to grow, and domestic manufacturers continue to respond to growing demand and increased regulation of packaging by kicking up prices at an unrealistic rate, we\u2019ll likely see even more consumer pushback in coming years \u2014 particularly if the Chinese government fails to put in place specific regulations on not just superficial issues like packaging and bundling of mooncakes but also their fillings.

Lose the Logos \u2013 As China becomes the undeniable focal point for the international luxury industry, Chinese will also rapidly become more sophisticated consumers of brands.\u00a0 They will shed the most obvious signs of status slavery and gain a deeper understanding of the quality that brands represent.\u00a0 There will be less buying of a brand merely to become part of a group and more purchases made to show one\u2019s own taste or individuality.", "2. Inspiration from Within \u2013 The rise of the internet, fashion blogs, street style pictures, and a greater general confidence means that inspiration might start to come more from the young people on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai and less from celebrities, western magazines, and Tokyo and Seoul. Those interested in style \u2013 into their thirties \u2013 might look to the post \u201880 generation for determining what is cool in areas well beyond just dressing.", "3. Spending Abroad \u2013 Chinese are already the biggest spenders on luxury goods \u2013 per visitor \u2013 in Paris and other locations.\u00a0 Their pursuit of lower prices and greater selection abroad will be a sort of \u201cChinese Remedy\u201d to the recession, at least in some parts of the economy.", "4. Better Selection at Home \u2013 Availability of luxury products in China has always lagged behind the perceived importance of the market.\u00a0 Soon, more brands will open their most dazzling flagships and the latest pop-up boutiques in Shanghai and Beijing.\u00a0 There will be more products tailored for the Chinese market and their will be less slighting of Chinese consumers \u2013 full product lines will arrive here and they will not feature products from seasons before.", "5. Chinese Fashion Designers \u2013 Most of them will be considered derivative, low-quality, and not worthy of notice.\u00a0 However, the sheer number of young people studying fashion design and the number starting up fashion brands guarantees that more will gain greater acceptance both locally and abroad.", "6. Art Market Blossoms Again \u2013 This might be largely on the backs of Chinese spending and thus the focus could be less on contemporary art and more on the old masters.\u00a0 In the end of 2009, we already saw signs of this with the sale of \u201cEighteen Arhats\u201d by Ming Dynasty painter Wu Bin for RMB 170 Million at auction.", "7. Emissions Cutting \u2013 Among an elite group of urban hipsters, there may be efforts made to live a more carbon-neutral life through buying secondhand, riding a bike, or eating less meat.\u00a0 This is likely to stay quite limited at first.", "8.Charity Goes Mainstream \u2013 In every part of life, charity and giving will become rapidly more obvious.\u00a0 Events, brands, and all spending will increasingly have to have charity focus.\u00a0 Charity will become one of the main subjects of conversation and it will start to be a loss of face for anyone with any money not to be giving. A concern \u2013 and excuse for not giving \u2013 will remain the uncertainty with respect to how said money is used [by the charities].", "9. Buddhism \u2013 This will be another big topic of conversation for the wealthy and others. It will be increasingly acceptable and even expected in some circles for people to express devotion to Buddhism and causes related to it.", "10. Sanya \u2013 Vacationing will continue to blossom and [the Hainan province resort city of] Sanya will be the major focus.\u00a0 At this point much of the spending there is in the form of gifts to government officials or business partners, but affluent families will increasingly take their own \u2013 self-funded \u2013 vacations there.", "Nels Frye is the Editor-in-Chief of LifeStyle Magazine, China\u2019s leading bilingual publication focusing on architecture, inner space, decor, luxury goods, travel, and other LifeStyle subjects.

Of these 12 new hotels, the first should be Kempinski Xiamen, which recently held its topping-out ceremony and is expected to open early next year. According to the China Economic Review, Kempinski\u2019s expansion plan is part of its broader strategy to account for 20% of the hotel group\u2019s total\u00a0turnover and profits by 2013, over the current 15%.", "In addition to its expansion plan, 4Hoteliers says that the Kempinski Group is planning to open a \u201cChina-Only\u201d five-star hotel brand, Nuo.\u00a0From an article last month:", "The group also expects its business to blossom in the country after the Nuo brand comes into existence and expands its network.", "\u201cNuo and Kempinski will share the same team, resources and technology.

But if Nuo tries to target a different demographic, e.g., younger, middle-class, white-collar travelers, they risk working hard to attract a demographic that is still ill understood, amorphic, and largely unwilling to choose luxury over necessity.", "As the Kempinski Group\u2019s broader plan for Nuo takes shape in coming months, it will be interesting to what kind of marketing and branding approach they\u2019ll adopt in order to address the difficulties inherent in launching a presumably less expensive version of the \u201cKempinski Experience\u201d in China."]}, {"title": "Selling To The Chinese: Digital & Social Media Marketing", "meta": "January 6, 2010", "paragraphs": ["\u00a0", "New department stores like Lane Crawford in Beijing have increased the number of luxury brands available to potential buyers in Beijing", "While many luxury brands are counting on ostensibly luxury- and brand-mad Chinese consumers to bring in steady profits for the foreseeable future, industry insiders \u2014 or research groups \u2014 with feet on the ground know that Chinese consumers are far from a uniform group. As luxury expert Patricia Pao, of the Pao Principle in New York, recently wrote, contrary to the beliefs of many brand managers, there is no \u201cone\u201d China. As major luxury brands like LVMH venture outward from Beijing and Shanghai and work to develop a stronger presence in second- and third-tier cities like Xi\u2019an, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Changsha, it\u2019s critical for them to take geographical, cultural, (in some cases) linguistic, and demographic differences into account:", "Market leaders such as Louis Vuitton have saturated first-tier cites and are aggressively moving into second- and third-tier markets. Take Xi\u2019an as an example. Louis Vuitton is leveraging its experience and economies of scale to expand in the capital of the Shaanxi province. The French company is bullish about Xi\u2019an because it is the transport hub that connects western and eastern China, and it\u2019s a major beneficiary of government investment. But Louis Vuitton is adjusting its marketing and promotional strategies to reflect the fact that Xi\u2019an and other cities in northwest China have the largest urban-rural gap in China, and have been hit hard by the financial crisis.", "As major luxury brands venture westward, and try to court the gradually emerging middle class in China\u2019s vast interior, it appears that, in addition to keeping in mind the huge diversity in consumer behavior (and increasingly crowded retail market) that exists in that country today, brand marketers need to start thinking digitally.\u00a0A new Forbes article by market researcher Shaun Rein (Twitter)\u00a0suggests that one of the most important Chinese consumer trends we can expect to see pick up steam in 2010 is that of digital and social media marketing. According to Rein, Chinese consumers are increasingly being influenced by digital media, and companies need to invest more heavily in these forms\u00a0of outreach at risk of missing out on a potentially lucrative (and relatively low-cost) method of reaching and creating new customers.", "From the article:", "In China, most multinationals only spend 2% to 3% of their marketing budgets on digital initiatives; 8% to 12% is typical in the U.S. This makes no sense, for Chinese spend relatively more time online than with other media like TV or print, compared with American consumers. Logically, brand managers should spend much more online.", "Why don\u2019t they already? Part of the blame lies with their advisers. Most advertising agencies have limited digital marketing capabilities and relegate their online campaigns to junior people. They also prefer to work with television and sporting events, where there is more money and more personal visibility for them. Moreover, media buyers in China prefer to spend your money where it benefits preexisting relationships of theirs, or where they can get preferential treatment such as rebates.", "Brand managers need to push their media buyers to embrace digital marketing more strongly. They also need to work with marketing agencies that have strong in-house digital capabilities.", "Chinese consumers are buying more, but they are also getting more sophisticated and building higher expectations. Companies need to keep up with both their problems and their needs. Multinationals need to build on consumer trust in their international brands, and they need to look for ways to expand their sales through the right channels and connect with consumers through the right marketing plans. This will often mean creating an e-commerce platform and emphasizing social media and digital marketing as primary rather than secondary ways of connecting with customers.", "Consumer spending in China is increasing, but, just as important, it is also evolving. Every company selling products there needs to evolve, too.", "Rein\u2019s concluding point is the key, here. China\u2019s consumer class has emerged onto the scene and evolved at a breakneck pace. This is particularly noticeable in places like Beijing, where the more sophisticated (or relatively long-time) luxury demographic has, over the course of the last 10 years or so, gone from worshipping the biggest names, like Louis Vuitton and Gucci, to branching out into less monolithic, more exclusive\u00a0brands like Goyard and\u00a0Azzedine Ala\u00efa (though it must be said that part of this comes down to\u00a0greater choice in places like Beijing now, since major department stores \u2014 which carry more hard-to-find brands \u2014 like Lane Crawford have opened in China\u2019s capital in recent years). ", "As luxury buyers (at least in the more cosmopolitan cities) become less brand loyal, it\u2019s becoming more important for luxury brands to recognize that they might risk alienating long-time customers by becoming more ubiquitous. Digital and social media marketing is a good way to do this. By tailoring messages to target demographics and to a given medium or platform \u2014 e.g., white-collar social media sites like Kaixin \u2014 brands like Tiffany & Co. have, over the last year, been able to give potential customers the feeling of exclusivity that traditional marketing simply can\u2019t instill. ", "As we wrote last fall (\u201cTiffany, Other Luxury Retailers Push Digital Outreach In China Market\u201c), the success of Tiffany\u2019s digital campaign for their \u201cKeys\u201d line attests\u00a0to the efficacy of digital outreach in China, and offers lessons for other luxury brands:", "Perhaps to combat customer fickleness in China, several high-end brands have entered the digital realm, starting online-only advertising and marketing campaigns designed to directly target key audiences. This year alone, both Cartier and Coach began large-scale Chinese-language online campaigns, and now Tiffany & Co. has joined its rivals in launching a digital campaign to promote its Tiffany Keys collection in Mainland China. To localize this campaign for the China market, Tiffany has incorporated many of the online \u201ccharacteristics\u201d that appeal to young (primarily female) Chinese netizens: BBS, blogging, and social media.", "\u2026", "As more brands look to the digital space to target specific potential buyers in China, it would make sense that exclusive marketing and branding initiatives, carried out through social media, microblogging and BBS could become the rule, rather than the exception.\u00a0Instead of\u00a0diluting a brand\u2019s equity in the Chinese market, large-scale online campaigns would probably create brand equity and loyalty in China among a younger group of potential buyers.

At that time, everyone from Porsche execs to attendees was enthusiastic about this sedan\u2019s prospects in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market and the jewel in the crown of top luxury automakers like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and even Bugatti and Rolls-Royce.", "Prior to the unveiling of the Panamera Turbo on April 20th, several blogs, including the former iteration of Jing Daily, maintained this same level of optimism, noting that the popularity and prestige enjoyed by companies like Porsche in the Mainland market would mean that anything produced by Porsche and sold in China would be a hit. As we wrote at the time, the Panamera \u2014 along with 12 other new models \u2014 was, seemingly overtly, designed with the Mainland market in mind:", "Recession be damned, Porsche is set to debut their new Panamera Turbo at the upcoming Shanghai Auto Show. Cash-rich Shanghainese and auto aficionados alike will get a glimpse of the new sedan \u2014 which has so far received lukewarm reviews from auto publications \u2014 on April 20th.", "In addition to the Panamera, 12 other cars will make their debut in Shanghai, including two new BMWs and the Audi A3 (sure to be a hit in China, land of the government-owned black Audi sedan). This year\u2019s Auto Shanghai event is promoted by organizers as the biggest yet, apparently surpassing the scale of the Geneva and Detroit Auto Shows.", "Since then, the Panamera has become available throughout China, launching recently in Xiamen, and as expected, it isn\u2019t cheap by any means. As China Car Times notes:", "The Panamera starts at a whopping 1.84 million RMB (US $269,558) for the Panamera S model, whilst the Panamera 4S is 1.92 million (US $281,278) and the Panamera Turbo tops the range at 2.49 million RMB (US $364,782).", "While the brand prestige of Porsche should, in itself, propel the Panamera to some success in the China market, it won\u2019t be without its challenges. For one thing, its high price point places it among tough competitors who have a proven track record in China, models like the Mercedes S class 500L (2.09 million RMB) and Audi A8L 6.0 W12 quattro (2.5 million). If the Panamera is going to have a fighting chance in China, Porsche is going to have to appeal to the crowd who would be considering a top-of-the-line Audi or Mercedes. The runaway popularity of Mercedes\u2019 S-class, and the launch of other 4-door sedans by BMW (750i) and Maserati means the market for sporty four-door sedans in China is getting more and more crowded.", "Mercedes has made China a top priority this year, particularly as its traditional markets have faltered. By launching new initiatives in China, such as this month\u2019s new \u201cStarElite\u201d pre-owned sub-brand, Mercedes has worked hard to make it clear to potential buyers that its focus on the China market is not simply driven by the pursuit of easy profits; they\u2019re trying to show their true commitment to brand-building.", "Audi, too, has a long pedigree in China, and is regarded as a mark of both luxury and success in all major urban markets. While Porsche, too, enjoys the enviable reputation of these two competitors, its first foray into the four door sedan market is difficult because it is, in many ways, a fish out of water. Porsche will have to convince potential buyers of other sedans that it will provide them both the horsepower and comfort they would expect from established models like the S-class or A8.", "Another, more superficial, challenge faced by the Panamera in China is its awkward name. While this will certainly have little effect on sales, if the customers can\u2019t pronounce your name, they might be less willing to talk up your new model or buy it themselves. Admittedly, the name \u201cPanamera\u201d is a bit of a mouthful, as HuaShang (Chinese) jokingly noted:", "This new car\u2019s name is a little awkward-sounding, and will be a bit of a challenge for people to pronounce, but let\u2019s forget about language constraints and enjoy [the Panamera]!", "Tweet", "Follow @JingDaily ", "", "(function(){\n  var _w = 86 , _h = 16;\n  var param = {\n    url:location.href,\n    type:'6',\n    count:'', /**\u662f\u5426\u663e\u793a\u8f6c\u53d1\u6570\uff0c1\u663e\u793a(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    appkey:'', /**\u60a8\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5e94\u7528appkey,\u663e\u793a\u5206\u4eab\u6765\u6e90(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    title:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9(\u53ef\u9009\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u9875\u9762\u7684title)*/\n    pic:'', /**\u8f6c\u53d1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8def\u5f84(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    ralateUid:'', /**\u5173\u8054\u7528\u6237\u7684UID\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d1\u5fae\u535a\u4f1a@\u8be5\u7528\u6237(\u53ef\u9009)*/\n    rnd:new Date().valueOf()\n  }\n  var temp = [];\n  for( var p in param ){\n    temp.push(p + '=' + encodeURIComponent( param[p] || '' ) )\n  }\n  document.write('<iframe allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?' + temp.join('&#038;') + '\" width=\"'+ _w+'\" height=\"'+_h+'\"></iframe>')\n})()", ""]}, {"title": "Chinese Art Collectors Converge In Beijing At Global Collecting Forum", "meta": "October 13, 2009", "paragraphs": ["Western and Chinese experts discussed a wide range of important issues in art collecting at the Global Collecting Forum in Beijing (Photo: CRI)", "Although the last few years have seen the rapid rise of the New Chinese Collector of contemporary Chinese art, the relatively late arrival of Chinese collectors means that the vast majority of major works of contemporary Chinese art remain in the collections of Western art collectors (such as the former Swiss diplomat-turned-prolific collector Uli Sigg, who owns around 2,000 pieces) or Western art museums and galleries. Although buying trends are changing, as more Chinese collectors and curators start to bolster their collections and diversify the artwork they acquire, one of the unique challenges that art lovers in China must face is the dearth of contemporary Chinese artwork available for view in their local museums and galleries.", "With these issues \u2014 the underdevelopment of Chinese art museums and the growing interest in private art collection in China \u2014 in mind, this weekend the Global Collecting Forum was held at Beijing\u2019s Reignwood Theater.
