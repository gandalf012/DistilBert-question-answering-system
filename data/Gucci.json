[{"title": "Gucci Keeps Kering\u2019s First-Half Earnings High \u2014 But for How Long?", "meta": "August 1, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Last week, the French luxury group Kering, owner of a portfolio of brands that includes Gucci, Bottega Veneta, and Saint Laurent, reported its first-half 2019 earnings. Recording consolidated group-wide revenue of \u20ac7.6 billion, a rise of nearly 19 percent against the same period last year, Kering\u2019s continued success is certainly impressive considering the market climate.", "But is Kering\u2019s latest growth spurt soon to taper off, and will we see a change of direction for Gucci in particular by the end of the year?", "Gucci is, without a doubt, central to Kering. Out of the \u20ac7.6 billion generated by Kering brands in the first half of this year, Gucci revenue totaled \u20ac4.6 billion, 62 percent of the Group\u2019s revenue. Moreover, in the first six months of 2019, Gucci generated more sales than it did in the whole of 2016.", "Yet Kering\u2019s first-half report says Gucci is on a comedown after two years of unprecedented demand, and although there were margins of growth in the first half of 2019, revenues are leveling off. Although this is expected, given the speed at which luxury consumers move from brand to brand or collection to collection, there\u2019s reason for concern.", "To continue growing or at least stave off decline, Chinese customers will remain crucial for Gucci. In markets like the United States, the brand is struggling to gain more traction on social media among new followers and younger audiences. The brand has also faced recent controversies, such as its \u201cblackface sweater\u201d scandal earlier this year, which led to Gucci appointing Ren\u00e9e Tirado as its new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in July. In markets such as North America, Gucci has its work cut out if it expects to avoid decline and maintain momentum.", "With Chinese shoppers expected to spend more within mainland China this year, Kering will undoubtedly keep a close eye on revenue at its nearly 60 points of sale within the Mainland and nearly two dozen stores in Hong Kong and Macau. According to Kering\u2019s first-half report, nearly 86 percent of Gucci sales are generated at its 477 directly operated stores, 201 of which are in emerging markets.", "Gucci relies heavily on tourists to prop up in-store sales worldwide, and in the effort of attracting more of these traveling shoppers \u2014 many of whom hail from mainland China \u2014 the brand has invested heavily in refurbishments. (Gross operating investments for Gucci reached \u20ac125 million in the first half of 2019, a rise of more than 9 percent over the same period last year.) But are these efforts going to bear fruit in places that their biggest-spending shoppers visit?", "Gucci should be concerned this year about sales in two markets that are traditionally fairly reliable for mainland Chinese tourist-shopper spending: North America and Hong Kong. Chinese tourist arrivals are expected to continue to decline or stagnate at best, with visitors put off by continued US-China tension and a litany of other concerns, with business owners from Los Angeles to New York concerned they\u2019ll lose much-needed revenue from some of their most reliable big spenders.", "Hong Kong, where the luxury sector is effectively paralyzed at the moment, will also be a pain point for luxury retailers this summer. In response, expect to see Gucci (and the Kering Group) invest more in e-commerce in Asia, as well as mainland China operations, to fight expected weakness in attracting Chinese tourist-shoppers in these key markets.", "Taking the global view, typically North America is seen in the luxury sector as an indicator of consumer spending and trends \u2014 and the longer-term outlook is not looking good for Gucci. In the first half of 2019, Gucci\u2019s North America revenue rose a paltry 1.1 percent. Kering\u2019s report made one suggestion to justify this softness: a sharp rise in spending by American customers in Western Europe who have been holding back spending at home. But if this continues past the summer, red flags are flying for Gucci.", "Also, in the remainder of this quarter, Gucci will keep a close eye on Asia revenue within mainland China, as well as markets favored by Chinese travelers, such as Singapore, Thailand, and even the Philippines to discern how good (or grim) 2020 may look.", "Time will tell whether Gucci can expect a slow decline that necessitates a shot in the arm, or whether continued investment can delay a downturn. Plans have already been made to integrate the brand\u2019s product development and manufacturing processes, in tandem with rolling out major changes to its supply, logistics, and information systems. But will this be enough to keep the brand simmering in the minds of customers worldwide, or is Gucci\u2019s goose already cooked?"]}, {"title": "Learning from Gucci\u2019s Wild Success with Millennials and Gen Z", "meta": "July 15, 2019", "paragraphs": ["At a recent event, Gucci CEO, Marco Bizzarri, spoke about his brand\u2019s success with young consumers. Their numbers are remarkable: 62 percent of Gucci\u2019s $eight billion in sales last year came from consumers who were 35 and under (Millennials), and the brand\u2019s fastest-growing segment is consumers 24 and under (Generation Z).", "In the approximately four years since he joined Gucci, Bizzarri tripled the brand\u2019s revenue and has made critical strategic decisions \u2014 like appointing Alessandro Michele as his creative director \u2014 while also giving the brand a more contemporary and category-breaking attitude. With its strong appeal to the world\u2019s youngest luxury consumers, Gucci is on track to become the largest luxury fashion brand in the world if its growth trajectory continues at its current pace.", "One of the key enablers of their success has been investments in technology, as seen in their ArtLab: a futuristic factory where artistic experimentation is blended with 21st-century production processes. As a result, the brand can transform ideas and concepts into products at a higher speed than many of their competitors, meeting the Gen-Z demand for quick and unique product drops while enabling creatives to implement their ideas much faster than ever before.", "Bizzarri also smartly enlisted a \u201cshadow committee\u201d comprised of Gen-Z and Millennial members from around the world to meet with technology experts and discover new ideas and approaches. \u201cThese [young] people often know much more about certain things than you do,\u201d says Bizzarri on the importance of involving younger consumers in the development process. But what exactly can other brands learn from Gucci\u2019s uncommon methods?", "Accelerated market speeds", "We are living in one of the most exciting times for innovative luxury brands. Technological change and market disruption are both happening at a faster rate than ever before, and because information travels faster, consumers are better informed than ever. Therefore, the youngest consumers come equipped with the highest expectation\u2019s brands have ever seen \u2014 a dramatic paradigm shift from just a decade ago.", "Given this, permanent adaptation and reinvention are absolutely necessary now because consumers are less patient now. Thereby, technology becomes an enabler that optimizes processes, responds faster, and ultimately provides better and faster service. When consumers look for instant gratification, brands need to build preconditions so they can deliver against those expectations.", "Brand equity and brand storytelling", "Building up a strong brand story was one of the cornerstones of Gucci\u2019s success, and with Bizzarri\u2019s arrival, Gucci refocused sharply on creating brand equity. A brand\u2019s storytelling is one of the critical drivers of extreme value creation \u2014 a concept the best and most relevant luxury brands have mastered. In the years between Tom Ford\u2019s departure and Bizzarri\u2019s arrival, Gucci\u2019s positioning in the market became too vague and undifferentiated. This has changed. Now there\u2019s a very distinct and consistent brand attitude expressed through artistic mastery, advertising, and in-store experiences. This helps create a cohesive brand message for customers all over the world, but especially among Chinese customers, who are much more brand-obsessed than customers from other regions. And the brand personality Gucci has created feels relevant to them.", "Many brands focus too much on the product and underestimate the importance of rigorous and excellent brand definition and execution. This can make brands vulnerable and tends to lead to \u2018one-hit-wonders\u2019 instead of consistent success. Brands must combine great storytelling with excellent product execution to win over Millennials and Gen Zers these days. Given the quickly-evolving and highly-competitive landscape, a brand should undergo an audit to clarify its positioning at least every two years, if not more often. This is not to change a brand\u2019s strategy permanently, but rather to ensure that the strategy is both differentiated and relevant enough in a market with ever-changing trends and competitors.", "Listening to customers", "In markets like China where consumers spend their daily lives on WeChat (doing a significant part of their brand interactions via digital channels) opinions change regularly. Therefore, listening to consumers is an indispensable part of brand research. Traditional market research methods aren\u2019t working anymore because they\u2019re too slow, imprecise, or don\u2019t offer actionable insights in real-time. The infamous Dolce & Gabbana case in China demonstrated that perceptions can change within hours, and brands must be able to identify those changes as they happen. Social media listening is not sufficient for locating fast-paced shifts in consumer sentiment. Today\u2019s best practices involve advanced data querying technologies (including AI and machine learning) that offer rapid pattern recognition and the generation of timely and relevant counteractions.", "By making the target group part of the decision-making body, a brand ensures that the direction they take will resonate with those consumers. Too many brands still use \u201cguessing and hoping\u201d and then wonder why their marketing campaigns and product launches don\u2019t achieve their objectives. Listening to young customers by implementing up-to-date technical infrastructures and integrating them into decision-making processes takes guessing out of the equation and lets a brand know for sure that their content will be relevant.", "Gucci\u2019s success in today\u2019s market is unparalleled and stands as an example of how the correct combination of leadership, creativity, brand equity-focus, customer-centricity, and enabling technology can propel a brand to significant growth. Bizzarri and his team have done a good job at positioning their brand in a way that feels relevant to Millennials and Gen Zers, and since those demographics will only get more important with age, Gucci should have no problem prospering in the future.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle, and consumer brand strategy firm\u00a0\u00c9quit\u00e9.

Michele tapped Thomas de Kluyver, who shot his way up from a MAC counter to working all the top runway shows, as his new Global Makeup Artist for this and future projects.

Is this provocative campaign solely an attempt at media buzz or is it something more? While it\u2019s likely that Gucci\u2019s Hollywood-cum-Punk aesthetic will be attractive to a lot of the general public, will it really help the brand develop a strategic global luxury beauty business? Many are interested in seeing if Gucci will succeed considering how long it took them to jump into the beauty business in the first place.", "Meanwhile, at the top of the luxury beauty market, Chanel and Christian Dior (which has developed Dior Beauty as one of the most refined women\u2019s beauty brands on the market) are globally appreciated by Chinese customers and can already rely on healthy beauty sales to help them in an unpredictable leather luxury goods and apparel market.", "Much of that business is a result of China\u2019s massive younger generations. Though the country\u2019s Gen-Z customers aren\u2019t able to purchase luxury accessories and apparel yet, they can afford to buy Dior\u2019s Addict lipstick or Chanel\u2019s Le Blush Cre\u0300me De Chanel. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential for today\u2019s luxury brands to have affordable accessories \u2014 because this part of the market in China can drive future growth. After all, the girl who buys lipstick today is the one that could afford to purchase luxury bags, shoes, and apparel tomorrow, and she will prioritize familiar luxury brands that have already made her feel beautiful.", "Because of this, other established brands like Herme\u0300s and Gucci have decided to enter this important market, despite some strong competition (Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s beauty business by L\u2019Ore\u0301al, for example, makes revenues of over \u20acone billion annually.)", "While Herme\u0300s is taking a second step after enormous success with their early brand fragrances, Gucci\u2019s gains have been more uneven.

Gucci remained the only holdout, choosing instead to leave the Guangzhou market entirely for reasons unknown. Maybe Gucci\u2019s strategy of leaving Guangzhou and coming back in a low-key fashion seven years later is a form of very slow marketing.

Is it better to save your lavish grand opening celebrations for younger, more rapidly growing markets in inland China, such as Chongqing or Kunming, where consumers are less brand-savvy and will be more easily wowed by celebrity appearances? Is the low-key launch (or re-launch, in the case of Gucci in Guangzhou) better for top-tier cities, or is it simply too risky? Clearly, Gucci is formulating an expansion strategy in China that puts it at odds with brands like Burberry, which recently held an extravagant blowout to celebrate its new Beijing flagship, and Diane Von Furstenberg, who held an arguably more over-the-top Red Ball in Shanghai.

There are different types made-to-order for customers: one is the customization \u201cunder the brand,\u201d which aligns with the public perception of made-to-order luxury. The second type is \u201cabove the brand,\u201d meaning that the customers still want something specific from the brand that\u2019s outside its current offerings.

For others, made-to-order accounts for as much as 70% of the companies\u2019 sales, according to Yaok\u2019s research.\u00a0", "Along with made-to-order expansion in China, issues have surfaced. \u201cChinese people have different body types compared to Europeans, so when European luxury brands use their sampling for Chinese customers, it doesn\u2019t fit,\u201d Dr. Zhou says, adding that one loyal Herm\u00e8s customer told Yaok Institute that he once had to look at other brands\u2019 gloves instead of a pair from Herm\u00e8s because they didn\u2019t fit perfectly. Although she already started seeing brands tackling the issue with infrared technology, it hasn\u2019t been widely adopted.\u00a0", "The industry\u2019s inclination for a sense of rarity may also be a potential problem. While brands like Chanel and Celine reportedly need six months or longer to ship a bespoke order, some newcomers in the West, like the leatherwear producer 1Atelier have built their business model on made-to-order, promising to deliver their customized bags (cost between $300 and $8,000) in three weeks. Ermenegildo Zegna is also promising a similar delivery time for their made-to-measure suits and shirts in China, according to its website, but it would still take most other brands more than three months.\u00a0", "Zegna promises a 21-day delivery time for their made-to-measure offerings in China, according to its website, but it would take most other brands much longer.

This online disruption of the luxury market is shaping how millions of Chinese consumers shop daily. In fact, all brands and retailers have embraced digital channels to some extent in order to counteract losses in the offline retail section and capitalize on this growing sector which is willing to spend.\u00a0", "Over the past month, global luxury brands have attempted to get on board with the fast-moving digitalization trend in China too. Prada has officially launched a Tmall flagship store and Belgiain leather luxury house Delvaux landed on JD.com this month. Runway shows went virtual at Milan and Paris fashion weeks as a range of digital campaigns debuted to maintain connections with Chinese consumers, like Fenty Beauty\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day campaign. This successful venture featured three loveletters from their Greater China Brand Ambassador, Fan Chengcheng as well as the spokesperson Wang Ju, and the fashion influencer, Mia Kong.\u00a0", "As expected, most of the international brand attempts, however, have shown less flexibility than local players and struggled to drive online traffic and sales. Without the presence of celebrities and KOLs, these campaigns and events failed to engage Chinese netizens in the public domain unlike domestic attempts on Weibo.\u00a0", "By contrast, many experienced homegrown brands have easily adapted to unexpected situations like the COVID-19 crisis thanks to solid customer relationships built through the new phenomenon of social selling. These initiatives, including posts in group chats and WeChat moments, alongside live-streams are being used to target consumers as they go about their lives. They are connecting with consumers by any means possible and are emerging as dynamic new marketplaces in themselves.\u00a0", "Social selling \u2014 the act of building up social relationships to nurture sales \u2014 is built upon a series of tactics rooted in \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cprivate domain\u201d traffic. Private traffic involves the direct communication between content providers and consumers (or users) thereby minimizing the dependency on third parties such as social platforms and e-commerce sites.\u00a0", "\u201cThe closest term used outside China is owned-traffic, like email lists and website traffic,\u201d explains Matthew Brennan, Co-Founder and Managing Director of WeChat marketing consultancy, China Channel. This makes sense given that Chinese netizens are not used to communicating by emails and open web is less important in China. WeChat is one of the most fundamental channels where brands typically build up private traffic.\u00a0", "Unlike public traffic which is owned by third-party platforms, private traffic exists exclusively between users and merchants, or brands. These small-size online merchants are on a tight marketing budget; interestingly, the idea is as yet relatively under-recognized by bigger, more-established brands. As more players transition into e-commerce, the domain of private traffic has become quite saturated.", "Meanwhile, the algorithms of these social and e-commerce platforms, like Weibo, tend to squeeze content providers, such as brands and KOLs. These content providers are therefore forced to pay these gatekeepers or platforms to earn higher visibility and engagement. For example, the public traffic on Taobao and Tmall is mostly driven by content fuelled by livestreams, products on sale, and recommendations. Therefore public traffic is generally controlled by e-commerce sites and social media platforms, unlike private traffic.\u00a0", "In the context of luxury business, the possession of traffic is crucial for maintaining the social prestige of the brands. According to Pablo Mauron, Partner and Managing Director China at Digital Luxury Group, an international digital agency for luxury brands, what tends to define a luxury brand is the sales path and consumer journey. As Mauron explains, \u201cunless that traffic is owned by the brand, it will be difficult to plan activations around it.\u201d\u00a0", "Yet, private traffic is not something new to international luxury brands: When the term was yet to be defined, luxury sales assistants in China kicked off CRM (Customer Relationship Management) on WeChat as the app has taken on the functions of messages and emails. By adding valued customers on WeChat, previewing newly launched products and by addressing inquiries, sales assistants could (and do) construct intimate relationships with clientele through a series of exclusive services.\u00a0", "But, it was not until the COVID-19 outbreak that the draw of private traffic was fully understood. On the one hand, brands who adopt the private traffic model should narrow-down on promotional activities in the public domain, as many insiders highly recommend; On the other, they need to resort to digital selling to offset the offline sales drop-off seen during the crisis. In such cases, the importance of private traffic can not be overstated.\u00a0\u00a0", "Under quarantine, WeChat Moments, in particular, have transformed into online boutiques.

She told Jing Daily that her moments are now filled with new products photos and descriptions posted by sales assistants. \u201cMost of their posts keep consistency with the brand\u2019s personality.\u201d However, she also pin-pointed the differences between boutique advisors and other sales-related accounts, adding, \u201ctheir moments are more boutique vibe than daigous \u2014 meaning they won\u2019t remind you of outlet-retail despite posting discounts or presale events.\u201d\u00a0", "Zhou continued stating that even sales advisors from some lower-profile luxury brands like Goyard have resorted to social selling on WeChat moments \u2014 most likely in response to the current climate of dropping sales. Multiple-angle photos tagged with retail prices, detailed product descriptions, and regular updates at least every other day have been appearing in her feeds.\u00a0", "The human-intensive workflow involved in the typical luxury CRM is also necessary for the maintenance of private traffic. While chat automation helpers such as WeTool and AI-powered chatbots have been invented to improve the efficiency of managing multiple group chats simultaneously, they are unable to fill the role of one-to-one conversations, especially in the luxury sector. After all, the invaluable personal connection with customers cannot be fully replaced by technology.\u00a0", "Yet, there are still alternatives of facilitating digitalization of CRM. As the WeChat ecosystem is becoming more self-contained and well-developed, users\u2019 data can be accessed if they follow brands\u2019 WeChat subscription accounts and service accounts. The key to winning WeChat, essentially, is to collect and manage users\u2019 data as this will result in a better understanding of customers, facilitate organic reach, and ideally, convert traffic into sales.\u00a0", "Many brands tend to be disappointed by the low follower count and low engagement of their WeChat official accounts. But brands need to be aware that the size of it\u2019s WeChat audience might not be the most relevant indicator of success. As Mauron explained to Jing Daily: \u201cBuilding broad, unqualified audiences on WeChat is irrelevant \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be a numbers game. In order to build a qualified community of clients and prospects on WeChat, it is therefore important for brands to develop value-added services on the platform, such as loyalty programmes and customer service solutions.\u201d", "WeChat Mini Programs, along with features such as livestream and Channels (short-videos) have flocked to the ecosystem, creating an infrastructure for those value-added services as well as capturing users in the WeChat database. WeChat Mini Program is not only an extensive digital sales channel outside Tmall but also a curated online gallery for campaigns. Brands such as Prada, Gucci, and Dior have all launched mini programs that have seen organic engagement impact their WeChat official accounts.\u00a0", "Moreover, the CRM inside the WeChat ecosystem is more trackable than the traditional model, according to Dayo Liu, Business Partner at the Chinese-specialized e-commerce consultancy Data Insider. Liu told Jing Daily, \u201ceach step in the course of e-marketing is trackable, from how many touchpoints reaching consumers to the point when purchasing decisions were made.\u201d Therefore, the CRM based on the private pool contributes to the reactivation of clients and drives a long-term healthy relationship with valued customers \u2013 what each luxury brand needs in order to achieve organic growth in the competitive market.\u00a0", "While the pandemic in China seems to have passed its peak and luxury retail is predicted to normalize \u2014 according to Chinese officials \u2014 the acceleration of digitalization in the country has been game-changing. This step-up is forcing luxury and fashion companies to expedite their long-term China digital strategies. The Private traffic that many brands have resorted to during the crisis, in parallel with public traffic, is expected to facilitate omni-channel marketing and maximize customer lifetime value afterwards \u2014 a plus for any brand hoping to leverage digital in China.\u00a0\u00a0"]}, {"title": "From Consumers to Creators, a Manifesto of a Young Chinese Shopper Today", "meta": "March 17, 2020", "paragraphs": ["In response to the coronavirus, Jing Daily is highlighting the community of individuals that together are building the luxury industry in China.

In a hypothetical consumer research setting, she would be listed as a young Chinese millennial educated abroad; a fashion devotee and only child from a well-off middle-class family.

As a Shanghainese, she grew up in the fashion capital of China, passing the likes of Gucci and Louis Vuitton\u2019s hoarding along the Nanjing West road on a weekly or daily basis. The American reality TV show Project Runway \u2014 known for its caustic presenter Tom Gunn \u2014 also had a particularly strong impact on her growing up.

It was commonplace to spot them dressed in identikit clothing from brands like Canada Goose, Gucci, and Dior, hanging around the local luxury mall (Copley Place) as they swapped credit card swipes for the latest trends.", "Conscious of this fact, Sophia wanted to be more than a trend-follower. She went to get a business graduate degree and immersed herself in the luxury business category. When she returned to China, she started her career in the PR sector at a luxury management company where she helped the company to build a truly homegrown Chinese luxury brand. The dream was big and hard to achieve and the young returnee soon discovered the intricacies of navigating luxury on the mainland: \u201cIn China, luxury is about preserving culture and heritage\u2026 It\u2019s hard to capture the soul of this business and turn it into a profitable one.\u201d", "At one point in the conversation, Jin recalled a time when she attended a luxury retail event when the words of Laurent Claquin, President of Kering Americas, had a strong impact on shaping her outlook as a consumer. His talk, outlining how being unsustainable fundamentally threatens a brand\u2019s existence and future, hit home and since that revelation, her consumption has taken on a more conscious slant. Now, she considers herself an active co-creator of brands. \u201cI am looking for quality in my purchases,\u201d she explained proudly, adding, \u201cfrequent pop-ups hosted by brands like Louis Vuitton seem to mean so little and go against the principle of sustainability.\u201d", "This January, Jin quit her Anne Hathaway life and started an apprenticeship at an unnamed business consultancy firm. In the interview below, she recounts how the unexpected outbreak has reset her personal relationship with the luxury industry and her consumption habits, as well as it\u2019s a knock-on effect on the global economy.

It embodies everything an ethical brand may need, it\u2019s beneficial to consumers, workers, and the environment. Its functional pieces are minimalistic and transformable and are all locally-made with environmentally-friendly material.", "In China, one of my favorites is a local cashmere brand Vogo and I also love a perfume brand called Maison Francis Kurkdjian. I have been dying to check out Comme Moi, a designer brand created by the Chinese model Lu Yan. Currently, I don\u2019t shop luxury or fashion as much as I did before the outbreak, I\u2019m more likely to splurge on wines and food.", "If we think of the brands of the future, what qualities would you look for from them?", "As I mentioned, I want to be a co-creator of the brands I follow. In the future, brands should be conscious of the current concerning issues in society like gender inequality or global warming. They also need to be community-engaging and provide an aspirational lifestyle or ignite a cultural movement. For example, I liked how fashion is used to empower the LGBTQ group in a documentary called Paris is Burning. We watched it in my fashion history undergraduate class and it was really powerful to see what fashion can do.", "What\u2019s your favorite shopping destination?", "It\u2019s mostly online, from local e-commerce destinations like Taobao, Tmall, and international platforms like Farfetch.", "Have your consumption attitudes and habits towards luxury or fashion shifted since the COVID-19 virus?", "In the past, I wanted to go to an offline store as part of retail therapy. In general, I think the virus will accelerate a lot of changes in consumption habits in China. E-commerce is so accessible here and stores that don\u2019t serve customers thoughtfully will lose their competitiveness. Retail spaces, however, will become a source of experiences beyond mere transactions.", "The COVID-19 virus has reset my thinking about the fashion industry and made me think about how unnecessary or how pointlessly wasteful it can be. I am an advocate of sustainable fashion and the outbreak of the virus only reinforces this idea. Comparatively speaking, luxury brands like Louis Vuitton that keep pushing out pop-up stores are rather superficial; this strategy doesn\u2019t create much meaning beyond showcasing quality-made products.", "Where were you when you heard the outbreak of the virus, how did you feel?", "I first spotted news about the virus from the Financial Times and then gradually read about it from Chinese media. You could see more and more people wearing masks on the street which spread a sense of hysteria and paranoia. Home-quarantine was recommended around the celebration of Chinese New Year dampening the holiday mood. However, beyond the heavy-hit Wuhan province in China, I could never have foreseen how the virus would impact global activities as it is now.", "Have you ventured outside since the outbreak of the virus? What changes have you noticed?", "I have been taking walks outside lately, about twice a week now. The Shanghai government has done an amazing job of controlling the situation. We have to carry a pass when leaving and entering our homes. People are keeping a safe distance from one another and trying not to get the same elevator together. Delivery guys are leaving our online orders downstairs. But, masks are scarce and becoming a luxury \u2014 only a limited amount is given by the pharmacist to each person.", "What are you shopping during the crisis?", "Mostly necessities like groceries, but fashion-wise I am not in the mood to splurge at all \u2014 besides beauty products. During the outbreak, one of my favorite brands from the Shiseido group, IPSA, has been holding frequent online discussions amongst loyal customers. I was invited to the WeChat group by my beauty associate from the store and I found the activities there brought a sense of ritual to my life. They organize all kinds of events throughout the day: sharing beauty tips in the morning, make-up competitions in the afternoon, and showing off products around nighttime. As everyone is battling against the negative news, the associates online are being sensitive and upbeat so it\u2019s not a lot of hard-selling but more entertainment. Besides, it\u2019s a lot of fun just being part of a group at this time of isolation.", "Did any brand campaigns leave a strong impression on you amid the virus?", "I noticed many foreign brands acted quickly and supported the situation in Wuhan with donations whereas homegrown brands in China actually devised many purposeful campaigns. Chinese brands are more digitally savvy and have been seen to react to trends faster than global brands. It could also have to do with luxury brands\u2019 positioning, going online diminishes their privileged identity. But marketing-wise, I think more brands will thrive by being more tailored to individual needs, diving deeper into content commerce, and serving customers\u2019 values on a deeper level than simply products in-store.", "What would you like to buy once the situation recovers? When I went to the mall the other day to exchange a shopping voucher, the sales associate recommended a facial mask made by a Chinese brand Inoherb. It was high quality but pretty cheap, about $29 (200 yuan). My friend also recommended another Chinese beauty brand, Perfect Diary.

Consequently, global luxury brands need to employ personalized marketing strategies and ad campaigns that break through the noise and become memorable and inspirational to this group of men. This is difficult when most Western brands still don\u2019t get the factors that influence the buying habits of Chinese men, which makes it harder for them to build an authentic relationship with this consumer segment.", "Given this, here\u2019s four insightful marketing strategies for global luxury brands interested in grabbing more of this lucrative market.", "In the West, when we talk about adaptability in retail, ZARA comes to mind. Inditex, the Spanish multinational clothing company that owns ZARA, has democratized fashion, empowering the consumer and transforming him into the \u201cdesigner\u201d of the brand. But few understand that Inditex\u2019s adaptability is the engine of its success. In fact, The Financial Times \u00a0reported that Inditex has become the world\u2019s biggest clothes retailer by sales because of its \u201cability to respond quickly to changing trends.\u201d", "In the 35 years since the apparel retailer opened its first store in A Coru\u00f1a, a municipality of Galicia, Spain, the brand has grown into a veritable giant that now encompasses not only the famous fast fashion apparel collections, but also accessories, beauty, and perfumes. No wonder luxury brands want to become \u201cthe new ZARA.\u201d Its flexibility is seen as the ideal model for a market like China, where consumer trends are forever shifting, and fastness is constantly trending.", "Let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s little continuity in design trends in China, and conservative or \u201ctimeless\u201d collections don\u2019t hold the same appeal as the uber-hyped and always modern streetwear designs. Accordingly, luxury brands like Gucci that are \u201calways on\u201d and continue to innovate and bring high-frequency, fashionable apparel designs continue to do very well in the market. Gucci has morphed into a \u201cluxury ZARA\u201d and its business model has improved the runway-to-retail timeline, so that consumers can \u201csee now and buy now.\u201d Furthermore, Gucci has empowered the consumer, giving him a voice in the brands design strategy. And while monitoring trends in conversations on social media, Gucci has gain valuable and actionable insights into what the young buyers expects from the brand; hence, it\u2019s not surprising that Gucci\u2019s ad campaigns are an ode to sustainability, coolness, and youth. For example, Gucci\u2019s male collections incorporate design elements that in the West might appear as \u201ctoo feminine,\u201d but \u201cflower\u201d and \u201cbird\u201d patterns are in line with the shopping preferences of Chinese male luxury consumers, who, generally speaking, are more adventurous with their Western counterparts when it comes to personal styles.", "\u201cFeel Gucci\u201d is a term minted by Gucci\u2019s CEO, Marco Bizzarri\u2019s daughter, which was translated into \u201cfeel good.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that consumers buy brands and products that make them feel good. Zander Nethercutt, who writes for Medium, explains that \u201cpeople don\u2019t buy products because of what those products do, they buy products because of what they can do \u2014 or what they imagine they can do \u2014 with them.\u201d", "Nethercutt is right. Brands that convey emotions rather than information create a bond with consumers. In the end, emotions are the main justification for luxury consumption; otherwise it\u2019s impossible to explain why some fashion lovers would believe that a Gucci accessory is a necessity instead of a desire. While it\u2019s possible to find most of the luxury goods manufactured by retailers at lower price points in fast-fashion stores, consumers still want an actual Gucci wallet or white sneakers because of the emotions (i.e., pride, virtue, and success) they associate with owning those accessories.", "Gucci understands this, and their narratives and ad campaigns tend to have an emotional appeal. They create a tribe of like-minded people who share not only the same style notes, but also an identical outlook on life. The \u201cfeel Gucci\u201d mentality communicates a tolerant, youthful and digitally-first mindset, and this works very well with younger consumers, especially men.", "In the age of \u201cBig Data,\u201d smart retailers base most of their decisions on metrics and analytics. Evidently, brands who want to deliver personalized content will segment their consumers into demographic groups that have different purchasing habits and history.", "The ability to comprehend and influence consumer habits and predict trends offers a competitive advantage. And this is especially true in China\u2019s male apparel industry, because the local consumer base has an increased purchasing power and passion for luxury \u2014\u00a0but a displeasure for Western marketing campaigns that promote only Caucasian looking models.", "In order to succeed in China, marketers need to record the response of the public to the shopping patterns of KOLs, analyze consumer expectations, and formulate effective marketing strategies that respect cultural sensibilities and influence domestic consumers. Marketers can do this through analysis of social and behavioral data. For instance, Burberry uses consumer behavior analytics to run targeted marketing campaigns.", "Chinese millennials are highly influenced by male celebrities and KOLs, taking cues from their personal blogs or social media posts. Consequently, celebrity endorsements in social media can help brands increase their outreach in China. Take Tao Liang, aka Mr. Bags\u2019, Year of the Dog capsule collection, released in partnership with Longchamp brought in sales exceeding 5 million RMB ($772,200) in just two hours. And Jackson Wang, aka Fendiman, helped Fendi become a success in China.", "Seeing such high engagement rates that influencer marketing campaigns bring in, more and more luxury brands have partnered with idols and KOLs to get their products directly to consumers. From Guerlain\u2019s partnership with the popular Chinese actor, Yang Yang, or Burberry\u2019s collaboration with Kris Wu to Lanc\u00f4me and Wang Junkai, there\u2019s an influencer marketing campaign for every consumer base.", "For global brands wanting to grab more of China\u2019s ever-increasing male consumer market, they need to prioritize influencer marketing, big data and adaptability. But that\u2019s easier said than done."]}, {"title": "How Will China\u2019s Ban on Single Use Plastics Affect Fashion?", "meta": "February 10, 2020", "paragraphs": ["One fifth of the current global production of plastic \u2014 over 300 million tons \u2014 is produced in China. In fact, it\u2019s\u00a0the largest producer of plastic products, accounting for roughly 30% of worldwide manufacturing, according to Greenpeace. The mainland is also heavily reliant on coal to produce plastics and has been investing in incineration as a way to manage plastic waste (domestically and internationally), both of which pose significant threats to the climate. However, the country recently announced that it is banning single-use plastic. This decision could prove instrumental in removing single-use plastic from the fashion industry globally.\u00a0", "The move has been greeted positively as insiders consider the implications for luxury fashion, which has to varying degrees already been addressing the climate crisis. Orsola de Castro, Founder and Global Creative Director of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit global movement calling for more transparency in the supply chain, was upbeat about the announcement and its ramifications. \u201cWe often think of producing countries as being stuck into the old,\u201d de Castro says, \u201cbut some of the most exciting and forward thinking innovation comes from those countries that are directly involved with mass production.\u201d\u00a0", "Likewise, across the pond, Dean of Fashion, Burak Cakmak, at Parsons School of Design, in New York, was equally positive. He explained why the Chinese response is so notable:\u00a0\u201cIf the negative impact is at a certain scale, the Chinese government is not afraid to take control, even if it impacts business; this is ultimately putting the good of society ahead of the individual companies. A rare case around the world.\u201d Indeed, this is particularly insightful in light of the government\u2019s swift and decisive response to the coronavirus.\u00a0", "The Unseen Plastic\u00a0", "While plastic packaging is one of the main offenders and there has been a major shift away from this in luxury retailing much of the single use plastic in fashion is, according to Dr. Christina Dean, chair of environmental NGO, Redress, and co-founder of social brand, The R Collective,\u00a0\u201chidden away.\u201d However, this makes it no less problematic. \u201cA lot of the time most of the plastic packing the consumer never sees it, it\u2019s from a B2B level, and companies are trying to find better packaging. But ultimately the lowest hanging fruit is not even visible to the consumer\u2026 Almost every fabric is wrapped in plastic.\u201d\u00a0", "Andrew Keith, President of retailer Lane Crawford agrees and has been steering real change in this area since 2018: \u201cThis is not something the customer sees, but there is an enormous amount of plastic packaging being shipped every season.\u201d Consequently, since April 2018, Lane Crawford has collected and recycled more than 388.8 tonnes of waste material \u2014 which would have gone to landfill \u2014\u00a0through its platform that recycles transit packaging. \u201cStella McCartney and Brooks Brothers have all signed up so far with more coming onboard next year. And we also plan to pilot other programs in the coming months to accept plastic packaging from consumers,\u201d he adds.\u00a0\u00a0", "Individual brand efforts have also been shaping change in China. Dean\u2019s Hong Kong-based The R Collective creates sustainable luxury fashion using luxury brands\u2019 waste materials; it moved to more ethical packaging a couple of months ago, in part, to \u201cpre-empt the increasing banning of plastic packaging.\u201d Partnerships with Avery Dennison, and Hong Kong-based Hydroplast \u2014 both leaders in packaging \u2014 means it now has water soluble, no-plastic packaging that\u2019s dissolvable in warm water \u2014 and it\u2019s fully drinkable after the process.", "Implications for E-commerce", "In a country where anything is deliverable, Statista recorded that roughly 1.67 million packages were sent in September 2019 (interestingly, during the coronavirus outbreak many drones are finding additional uses and delivering spoken\u00a0 messages to citizens to remind them to wear masks). Orders sold online through the likes of Alibaba, JD.com, and other Chinese e-commerce outlets often arrive wrapped in multiple layers of disposable plastic \u2014 in some cases to counter vendors\u2019 fears that customers will reject soiled deliveries. In terms of how far e-commerce platforms go to implement the ban, it may depend on how exactly they want to position themselves.\u00a0", "But, that too might also be top down: Terence Ng, Retail Analyst at Tofugear, a company offering supply chain solutions, thinks the government could introduce levies to e-commerce companies given they use so much plastic. \u201cI could foresee a little increase in pricing or a percentage going towards sustainable initiatives. There may well be a pledge that consumers need to make \u2014 for example, if they don\u2019t return items within a certain time or maybe they pledge they won\u2019t return anything?\u201d Ng bases this prediction on the government\u2019s recent and effective clamp down on counterfeiting and Daigou as a stepping stone to indicate how a more stringent approach to sustainability might be applied. It will, no doubt, depend on further governmental policies and consumer reaction.\u00a0", "As a logistics leader, Alibaba Group\u2019s Christina Fontana, Head of Luxury and Fashion Europe, says that Chinese consumers are becoming very environmentally conscious. \u201cBecause of the powerful ecosystem we have built, we have the ability to innovate to promote a more sustainable environment and healthier world,\u201d she says. Alibaba\u2019s logistics arm, Cainiao, has pioneered the use of algorithms to minimize packaging by optimizing both package size and material use. L\u2019Or\u00e9al, for one, teamed up with Cainiao to decrease the use of plastic materials for all its brands on the platforms, and has switched to Forest Stewardship Council-certified sustainable paper, zipper paper cartons, and paper adhesives.", "Kevin Jiang, president of international business at JD Fashion and Lifestyle, explains that while the ban won\u2019t necessarily affect the company\u2019s co-operations, JD has taken efforts to reduce the reliance on single-use plastic (and other waste) in supply chains for a number of years now. \u201cWe see great opportunities for reusable packaging, particularly for online ordering. We hope to see the luxury sector take the lead on this.\u201d It\u2019s Green Steam initiative has reduced JD Logistics\u2019 use of disposable packaging by 27,000 tons. \u201cWe are happy to see more and more luxury brands reducing the unnecessary use of plastics and also more generally pay attention to sustainable fashion,\u201d he states.\u00a0", "How The Plastic Ban Will Affect Brand Supply Chains", "While luxury companies are making strides to address the plastic in packaging (from reducing and eliminating, as well as, degrees of reusing, recycling or composting), this ban might well result in a knock on effect that forces brands to look at the use of other plastics elsewhere in the supply chain. And although fast fashion is the major culprit for plastic-use in fashion, many luxury products feature plastics too. In fact, the separation of plastic in the supply chain lies at the very core of many R&D departments worldwide.\u00a0", "Gucci, for one, has already started using regenerated nylon yarn and switching from virgin plastic: in 2015, it began to replace virgin plastic in heels with a recycled option and in 2018 it produced 40,000 pairs of shoes with Thermoplastic Polyurethane soles, which contains 50% bio-plastic content. Stella McCartney is working to phase out virgin nylon in clothing this year and polyester by 2025. According to business network, Common Objective, switching from virgin polyester to recycled material \u2014 made by mechanically or chemically breaking down plastic drinks bottles \u2014 can reduce the carbon footprint of polyester by 40%. Prada\u2019s iconic nylon handbag got a make-over last year when the brand launched a line made from recycled ocean plastic; by 2021 the entire company aims to use nylon that has only been recycled. Lorenzo Bertelli, head of marketing and communication at Prada Group, told The Business of Fashion at the time that the move was inspired by global \u201cmarket demand.\u201d How this will resonate with Chinese consumers has yet to be seen as the company\u2019s allure on the mainland has been turbulent recently.\u00a0", "While these efforts are commendable, there is even more to be done in the supply chain before addressing the physical separation of virgin plastics from clothing. Christina Dixon, Senior Ocean Campaigner from Environmental Investigation Agency, highlights pre-production pellet loss. As a result of poor handling and transportation, pellets \u2014 the raw material used to make virtually all plastic products \u2014 are routinely spilt and lost to the environment at every stage of the plastic supply chain. \u201cThis is a key area where brands and manufacturers can play a role behind the scenes leveraging their influence on producers to ensure compliance with best practices in raw plastic material handling is part of international sourcing policies,\u201d she suggests. And, while many companies can hold suppliers to account, the possibility for real change could in fact be much more realistic when it comes from the Government down.\u00a0", "Moreover, the single-use plastic ban could well be an opportunity to implement extended producer responsibility measures to encourage more circular design of products and decrease reliance on virgin plastics, which would, in fact, have a broader impact on international supply chains. In order to meet this challenge, Dixon suggests where China could focus: \u201cWe would like to see it focus on innovation in reduction, re-design, reuse, and refill systems rather than plastic substitution with other materials, which is a potential risk of a shift towards \u2018environmentally friendly\u2019 alternatives, especially as these alternatives often have comparable environmental consequences \u2013 and are false solutions to the pollution problem.\u201d\u00a0", "Consumer Reactions", "When it comes to what consumers think about the ban, Dean, for one, is quite clear about what it will imply. \u201cWhat this will do in the eyes of the consumer is say that \u2018plastic is bad.\u2019 They won\u2019t want to see their luxury item in or near plastic. Finally the carrot and the stick are coming down on plastic packaging.\u201d And, consumer reaction has been positive so far. Comments online range from \u201cThis should have been banned earlier\u201d to \u201cI feel bad about using plastic bags\u201d to \u201cPlease hurry up, the environmental pollution is severe.\u201d One concerned netizen said it was great news, stating she has been using her own cloth bag in an effort to \u201creduce plastic waste every shop for the last two years.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "One self-titled, \u201cgreen advocate\u201d who works in marketing in Beijing says if her purchase comes wrapped in plastic she complains to the brand in question; however, it would not stop her from purchasing the brand, which proves there is still work that can be done to put real pressure on brands. Indeed, JD says that demand for plastic free is coming from some of its youngest consumers. \u201cWe have found that most of our young customers are willing to pay more to buy sustainable fashion products, so we expect the sustainable products we bring to the platform like Prada\u2019s recycled nylon bags to do well with our customers,\u201d continues Jiang.\u00a0", "As the world awaits the full ramifications of the coronavirus, our reliance on the mainland is increasingly obvious. Our collective future will be dictated by how much further the country\u00a0 is prepared to go in the war on plastics and given the enforcement of this ban (as opposed to previous failed attempts) we can be optimistic. Where exactly this new impetus is coming from (consumer reaction or other) doesn\u2019t matter but given the country\u2019s control of supply chains, the domino\u00a0 effect for luxury could result in dramatic change. We are already seeing how decisive reaction and containment to offset the Coronavirus is having a notable impact on global fashion weeks, sales and shares.\u00a0", "Parson\u2019s Cakmak concludes by highlighting that Kering was the first luxury group to launch there as a hub of sustainability innovation (the K generation). \u201cIt\u2019s one of these rare countries, when it comes from the top it triggers down very quickly and people will take ownership of it. It\u2019s an indication of the growing trend and could act as a prompt\u00a0 to take on other aspects.\u201d As an industry, we can hope that China will continue to react to this other crisis.\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Coronavirus Could Send Hong Kong into a Deeper Recession", "meta": "February 5, 2020", "paragraphs": ["While the coronavirus continues to spread at an unprecedented rate, it\u2019s also further segregating China from the rest of the world, particularly regions that are in political conflict with the mainland, namely Hong Kong.

On the same day, the New York Times reported that more than 2,500 medical workers went on strike, pressuring city officials to close all borders completely.", "Needless to say, this is particularly bad timing for Hong Kong\u2019s retail market, which has historically relied on mainland shoppers for much of its sales growth. Border closures are just the latest barrier to the city\u2019s economic recovery from losses caused by the ongoing protests that began last September. Just a month ago, before the coronavirus had spread to Hong Kong, reports showed the local economy falling into a recession near the end of last year\u2019s Q4 due to the social unrest.", "But more importantly, the closures are fueling discontent from wealthy mainland shoppers who see the action less as a way to remain safe amid an epidemic crisis and more as a symbolic gesture from this Special Administrative region that wants to be \u201ccut off\u201d from the mainland.", "\u201cThe coronavirus epidemic sits in the very center of the vortex of anger at an incompetent Hong Kong government, distrust of Beijing, and anti-mainlander xenophobia \u2014 all issues that have driven the past seven months of protests in Hong Kong \u2014 and, as such, risks becoming a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of discontent,\u201d explains Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of \u201cCity of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong,\u201d to the LA Times.", "Because of intensifying segregation at the Hong Kong border, we have looked at the various long-term strategies that brands and landlords are using to save their businesses amid this worsening situation:", "Accelerated expansion in mainland China vs. betting on local consumers", "Hong Kong has historically been a key region for many luxury retailers, and while the city can represent single-digit sales to a brand\u2019s global business, it\u2019s also where many APAC heads reside.

In 2020, Hong Kong\u2019s largest jeweler, Chow Tai Fook, plans to close about one-fifth of its stores in Hong Kong and will instead focus on the mainland market by where it will open an additional 600 stores on top of its current 3,636 stores.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate job,\u201d says Luciano Santel, Chief Corporate and Supply Officer of Moncler. \u201cWe are postponing and putting on hold some investments in communication, but what we are working on is direct communication with our clients.\u201d These changes are highly dependent on a company\u2019s CRM strategy.

Many brands have been negotiating rent reductions with their landlords since early protest days of September, and some landlords have even suggested rent cuts depending on a tenant\u2019s circumstances. This proves that simply collecting rent from what used to be one of the most desirable locations in the world doesn\u2019t work now, and many landlords are taking proactive measures.", "\u201cWhat a lot of people don\u2019t understand is that the landlords\u2019 business model has become disrupted,\u201d suggests Raymond Chow, executive director for commercial property at Hongkong Land, during a conference at Luxury Symposium in Hong Kong. \u201cThey have to shift their thinking to be more like retailers.\u201d Landlords must bend to the current demand by hosting more pop-up shops, for example. Chanel opened a J12 watch pop-up shop in July at Wharf REIC\u2019s Time Square and Gucci opened one in Harbour City this January.

Many industry insiders have also shared their concerns about whether upcoming major fashion shows, like Milan Fashion Week in late February and especially Shanghai Fashion Week in late March, will be postponed to prevent the potential of further spreading the virus.", "The postponing of trade shows and fashion shows may slow down new business from happening, but a more immediate concern is the disruption of the supply chain. Even though most factories are still closed due to the Chinese New Year break, many factories are now delaying the start of production because of the fear of inappropriate health procedures for their workers, which will have a ripple effect throughout the global fashion production cycle.", "According to Djen, usually, most of the Fall 2020 collection orders from Europe arrive in February, with manufacturing in March to meet the major delivery month of April, which now could be delayed until May or June. Furthermore, as a result of the ongoing crisis, the production of Autumn and Winter collections may also be delayed if the situation gets worst, directly effecting the businesses of most European companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturers.", "\u201cIf brands have not diversified their productions outside of China, then there isn\u2019t much they can do to minimize the losses,\u201d suggested Xi Yang, an attorney at the Seattle-based international law firm Harris Bricken that specializes in investment with China. \u201cFactories are closed now and will not resume production anytime soon.

And consumers that normally hit the stores around the Chinese New Year holiday have opted to stay home to minimize their outdoor exposure, which has added to a sharply declined foot traffic in shopping malls this January. Many malls have chosen either to significantly shorten their business hours or shut down completely. The loss is hard to quantify. On January 28, Dalian Wanda Commercial Management Group, the landlord of many high-end retail malls in China, waived rent for all Wanda Plaza\u2019s tenants across the country from January 24 to February 25, with estimated costs between $429 to $572 million (3 to 4 billion RMB).", "Going digital, however, seems to be the only bright spot for many vendors.

On January 30, it announced to its customers via WeChat, Weibo, and SMS that they can now make orders for facial sprays, collagen shots, probiotics, and protein powder via their WeChat Mini Program and enjoy fast home delivery. Industry veterans, too, are positive about the development of online retail. \u201cThe SARS in 2003 escalated a number of e-commerce companies\u2019 growth, such as Taobao and JD.com, brands should treat the crisis as an opportunity to develop omnichannel.\u201d suggested Gu Guojian, a retail expert to Chinese media linkshop.", "On the other hand, the virus has simply dampened the desire to shop. \u201cNot in the mood,\u201d \u201cWho am I showing off to,\u201d \u201cHealth comes first now,\u201d are a few common sentiments that we\u2019ve read so far.

Yet newer events often lack the consistency they need to accrue a legacy. Beijing and Shanghai\u2019s fashion weeks have a history of 22 and 17 years, respectively, but a host of regions using fashion as a quick and easy way to self-promote often fail to stabilize their events, and many disappear as fast as they appear.", "Chengdu Fashion Week, for example, launched a six-day event in 2018 with shows from local and international brands like Stella McCartney, yet it failed to return in 2019. Local retailer, Zhuo Ai, founder of the boutique Dressing for Fun, says Chengdu was both in \u201can experimental stage\u201d and lacking the investment needed for a long-term vision. \u201cFor brands in the local area, alternative fashion weeks are useful for support, although I think there are not that many local designers in these cities,\u201d she adds.", "Moreover, while some designers and press people often favor international fashion weeks over local domestic ones, others simply ignore alternative fashion weeks entirely or feel too inexperienced to take part in them. Another stumbling block for committees is their failure to attract the locally-born or based independent talent that helps to add a \u201ccool\u201d factor. Yet there are still other gaps: Only Shanghai Fashion Week hosts a public-facing fashion weekend (following their official event), China lacks a men\u2019s fashion week despite growing interest in the sector, and the country\u2019s first Couture week only launched last month. Overall, so many different fashion weeks run by different organizations make one wonder if a siloed, disjointed system is even feasible.", "Yet, despite these obstacles, China\u2019s newer fashion weeks present an opportunity not only for local brands but international ones. Indeed, with a forecasted consumer expenditure of 1.2 trillion yuan for 2025, foreign players need to double down on the market. Getting ahead in China and adopting more localized strategies that surround domestic fashion hubs will put a brand in a strong position to capitalize on China\u2019s consumer spending. Whether a brand is local or international, there\u2019s one message: Ignore the domestic market at your peril.", "Creative director Rocky Liang of The Mix Place, a creative destination from Guangzhou brand Exception de Mixmind, says that China\u2019s fashion weeks are only now taking their shape. \u201cException de Mixmind has featured on Xiamen\u2019s schedule and has held several events during Shanghai Fashion Week, too,\u201d Liang says. \u201cThese are more of a platform to showcase brand strength to gain further exposure, and where you find a promising fashion week you might find China\u2019s next big fashion capital.\u201d With this optimism in mind, Jing Daily\u00a0looks at a selection of China\u2019s fashion weeks, highlighting key opportunities for brands:", "When: Yearly, March and October", "Overview: For now, one thing is clear: Shanghai Fashion Week is China\u2019s most recognized fashion week. Over 17 years, it has built a credible, twice-yearly event that features hundreds of brands on runways, at parties, and in forums, while selling to thousands via showrooms and tradeshows. In response to how she keeps ahead of the competition, Madame Lu, the Vice Secretary-General of Shanghai Fashion Week, says, \u201cWe always do things that lead the industry. We haven\u2019t copied what the big four do but have managed to create our own ecosystem here in Shanghai.\u201d", "Why it matters to China: As Madame Lu explains, the organizing committees\u2019 focus is making Shanghai a fashion destination that is \u201cattractive to the international industry and also benefits the domestic market and independent talents.\u201d Indeed, the event\u2019s success lies in its ability to tap these local, emerging talents, which are often overlooked by other fashion weeks. It\u2019s a strategy that is paying off, and these designers are now bringing global attention to the city. Moreover, the big four are now looking to Shanghai for innovation: In September 2019, the British Fashion Council started selling tickets to London Fashion Week \u2014 copying a pioneering move introduced by Shanghai.", "Key brand opportunity: This fashion week is a global-facing event with a growing reputation among domestic buyers, making it an indispensable landmark for brands wanting to crack the Chinese market.

Next edition, March 2020", "Overview: The municipal government and the Shenzhen Industry Garment Association developed this platform to support their local designers, brands, and businesses. It aims to connect the production industry with research and development to unify fashion, particularly for domestic brands. Having run yearly since 2015, the event coincides with the trade show Shenzhen similarly to how Shanghai does with their trade show, Chic.", "IMG, the global management company, has helped to launch the event and currently consults the management committee. It has also brought with it a selection of American brands to participate, including Leanne Marshall, Cynthia Rowley, and Bibhu Mohapatra.", "Why it matters to China: Shenzhen has been uniquely developed for manufacturing and trade, and as one of the first Chinese cities open to the West (along with neighboring Hong Kong), it has become a vital hub of design innovation and production. IMG\u2019s Jennifer Taylor, VP of Global Consulting and Business Development, points out that, over the years, the city has been responsible for a tremendous amount of domestic manufacturing, and many global brands now source manufacturing in Shenzhen.", "Key brand opportunity: International brands can benefit in many ways from this event by making local manufacturing connections, building their network for distribution to the Chinese market, or increasing brand awareness. And while the Chinese marketplace presents some unique complexities for Western brands, the lure of potential growth undoubtedly attracts. \u201cShowing at Shenzhen Fashion Week and, therefore, participating in the Chinese retail landscape is a great introduction to the market,\u201d Taylor adds.", "When: Yearly, April and November", "Overview: Guangzhou Fashion Week, which was founded in 2003, is organized by the Guangzhou Fashion Designers Association and supported by the city\u2019s municipal commission of commerce. It\u2019s held in the city\u2019s business district at the GTland shopping Plaza.", "Why it matters to China:\u00a0 London-based knitwear designer and joint course leader in textile design at Central Saint Martins, Derek Lawlor, has been invited to Guangzhou twice and considers it a stepping stone into the Chinese market. \u201cUnlike some other fashion week bases, Guangzhou is an entrepreneurial and manufacturing hub with very interesting clusters of innovation. For me personally, it was an opportunity to see the variety of fabric and textile factories being produced here at different scales.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: A tier-1 city and China\u2019s third-largest, Guangzhou is located close to both Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Like these cities, Guangzhou\u2019s long-held position as a production base means it can also offer brands access to large fabric wholesalers and markets. And while the event has yet to receive much global recognition, it\u2019s developing international ties by inviting brands from outside of China. Lawlor, who showed alongside several brands from the UK and Italy that were invited by Guangzhou fashion week, is optimistic about the event, saying, \u201cI think the international brands built some stable connections and the industry made orders. The level of investment was impressive and there are opportunities there \u2014 you just need to hunt for them.\u201d", "When: Yearly, March and October", "Overview: Beijing\u2019s China Fashion Week is the country\u2019s most established and longest-running fashion week. However, it has failed to make the international impact of its industry rival in Shanghai. First organized by the China Fashion Association in 1997, the fashion week has bet on China\u2019s domestic winners over its 22-year history through a combined total of 200-plus shows and events, including brands like Ne-Tiger, Yaying, and Uooyaa. This lineup includes brands from other domestic cities like Dalien alongside non-Chinese brands from over 20 countries.", "Why it matters to China: After the loss of international sponsor Mercedes Benz, China Fashion Week has struggled to attract attention both inside and outside of China. Now, having recently partnered with WWD China, it\u2019s showing a new effort to amplify its global reputation. As one of the last fashion weeks on the circuit, most buyers will have allocated budgets by the time it takes place, which means most brands showing there are dependent on the attendance of national buyers. However, given the volume of China\u2019s domestic market, that still equates to big business, and both the event and the China Fashion Association can look to increase its dominance on their home turf.", "Beijing is also home to Fashion Now: a separately-organized alternative showcasing platform that runs before China Fashion Week. It appeals specifically to niche, independent designers and the 14th edition will take place in late March 2020.", "Key brand opportunity: According to an organization insider, this fashion week offers participating brands unrivaled opportunities for press coverage and media exposure, as Beijing is the unofficial home of China\u2019s media. The roughly 500 media companies in attendance can propel an unknown brand into the mainland\u2019s consciousness in its first season. Similarly to other fashion weeks, China Fashion Week hosts trade shows, B2B events, and forums, and it also organizes the China Fashion Awards, which connects and honors industry professionals.", "When: Yearly, December", "Overview: Xiamen has become a haven for fashion design in recent years. As the home of brands ranging from large conglomerates like Anta Sports and Septwolves to young, independent designers such as Ms Min and Sankuanz, it\u2019s fitting that Xiamen would want its own fashion week. Established by the municipal government, the condensed event focuses on local brands like Jiwenbo and The MSLAN with a peppering of international talent.", "Why it matters to China: The event targets highly localized brands, but it invited brands from Beijing and Shanghai to showcase this year. Despite these efforts, Xiamen Fashion Week is still decidedly irrelevant to younger, designer brands like Sankuanz, Ms Min, and Deepmoss, all of which are local yet disengaged. Dido Liu, the designer behind Deepmoss, has been showing seasonally at Shanghai Fashion Week since 2015 and suggests the event needs more time. \u201cI think for Xiamen, it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cI think they have big plans, but for now, other fashion weeks are more advanced. But, it can\u2019t be built in one day.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: The event bills itself as an \u201cauthoritative platform to promote China\u2019s fashion index and new trends.\u201d What this means precisely isn\u2019t clear. However, amid its plethora of B2B showcases, forums, talks, and events, Xiamen Fashion Week offers, at the very least, an outlet for brands to connect with media and potential buyers.", "When: September 2020", "Overview: Centrestage is Hong Kong\u2019s official fashion week and is supported by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC). Not to be confused with the city\u2019s textile trade fair, Hong Kong Fashion Week, Centrestage has been running since 2016 and is based at the commercial Hong Kong Exhibition Centre. There it operates a trade-show/showroom experience that offers a bounty of fashion shows from local and invited designers that are primarily sourced from mainland China and Asia. It also plays host to the environmental NGO Redress Design Award, industry talks, and many knowledge-sharing initiatives.", "Why it matters to China: Centrestage aims to be the best fashion week in Asia and for Asia. The event invites established brands like Korea\u2019s Juun J and Japan\u2019s Facetasm but is also striving to become a hotbed for new talent. For Jarno Leppanen\u2019s emerging independent menswear brand Ka Wa Key, which is based in Hong Kong and London, the strategy is working. \u201cIt\u2019s a good combination of east meets west,\u201d he says. \u201cCenterstage is a brilliant gateway to the Asian market. I think it\u2019s a really useful platform for Hong Kong designers, and even though it competes with NYFW time-wise, it still manages to stand out as its own interesting event.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: With 50 offices globally, the HKTDC organizes a range of buying missions. Alongside local luxury retailers, close to 7,000 buyers from 74 countries and regions visited in 2019. For brands such as FFixxed Studios, the main attraction of the event is access to these buyers. \u201cThe year we took part, the organizers had really strong buyers, and due to the concise selection of talent, you are guaranteed they will look at your collection,\u201d says FFixxed co-founder Fiona Lau. She also praised the production of the event and accurate brand representation, which is likely due to the HKTDC\u2019s 50 years of event experience.", "When: Nov 19 \u2013 21, 2019", "Overview: The first dedicated couture fashion week in China is a collaboration between the Jinan Municipal Government and the Asian Couture Federation to help promote the local textile and clothing industry of Shandong province.

Dr. Frank Cintamani, Founding President of the Asian Couture Federation, affirms this, stating, \u201cAs an on-going initiative, we hope to create a singular platform, giving Asia a much needed focal point for the Asian couture industry, and, as such, this affords a unique opportunity to create new markets for couturiers in China.\u201d Also, its student-focused forum, aimed at demystifying and explaining the business of couture, adds value to the event.", "Key brand opportunity: The appeal of homegrown couture designers is rising in China, as celebrities and high-profile clients alike are turning to names like Pei and Grace Chen when making investment purchases. VIPs and mostly Beijing-based media attended the event, and it was broadcast on CCTV to over 600 million viewers, which means access to a stream of potential new clients.

Meanwhile, influencers contributed to 36 percent ($2.1 million) of overall MIV for the event. Chinese celebrity Hu Bing, who made an appearance at Feng Chen Wang, was the top-ranking influencer, bringing in $83,000 worth of MIV.", "For many Chinese designers, starting at LFWM is often ideal because of familiarity. London can become a second home after finishing their studies, visa permitting. Taiwanese designer Yi-Ling Kuo of 1X1 has been living in London for eight years, and LFWM is, therefore, an obvious platform for her to show her technical knit brand in its third season. \u201cI feel inspired here,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are open-minded here, and being based in London, I\u2019m just used to how it works.\u201d", "Feng Chen Wang FW20 Runway.

But moves like these are generally restrained. As a buyer, Petersson explains that schedule-hopping from the bigger brands can cause issues for younger labels. \u201cIt gets more complicated when one of the bigger brands goes off and decides to show in another city whilst one city is already starting to show,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is sometimes detrimental to the younger brands that tend to get the slots on the first or last day and are more likely to be affected by this.\u201d", "She suggests it can be good for younger brands to experiment, though, as this not only adds excitement to a schedule but has practical benefits. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that young designers are trying out new cities to get a feel for where they are best suited, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s especially beneficial where the label is established in an \u2018off-schedule\u2019 city like Shanghai, where you won\u2019t benefit from the full force of international buyers.\u201d", "Backstage at 8on8 FW20.

Ka Wa Key has shown in London, Finland, New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai thus far. \u201cLondon has a great atmosphere, but it\u2019s getting smaller. It has fewer designers, buyers, press, and interest. This year, we go back to New York in February. It\u2019s a great city with great energy,\u201d he states.", "Like Ka Wa Key, most Chinese designers on the LFWM schedule featured women\u2019s looks as part of their collections in London, further threatening the stability of schedules. London\u2019s incubator Fashion East recently dropped its prestigious MAN platform, adding it into its women\u2019s sponsorship. Moreover, fashion weeks in Asia are usually mixed-gender. Former GQ Presents recipient, the US-based Private Policy, has gone one step further and switched to a womenswear schedule, presenting at NYFW in February. \u201cWe want to try a different fashion week schedule and keep exploring genderless fashion,\u201d explains co-designer, Siying Qu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to limit buyers or consumers but want them to feel comfortable.\u201d And while they are now, admittedly, \u201cfirmly embedded\u201d in New York, past slots at LFWM were useful. \u201cIt was a way to have more presence in Europe and open up the market with some shows,\u201d Qu adds. \u201cWe met with retailer Selfridges and now they carry us. London men\u2019s is very vibrant and exciting, and the city is still on the brand\u2019s radar. Our next plan for London will not be during fashion week, rather, we are looking for opportunities to present differently, like in a popup or a store.\u201d", "While it certainly affords emerging designers the freedom to experiment, according to Tomorrow\u2019s Lee, schedule-hopping is not ideal. \u201cI think for some established brands it\u2019s interesting to show in different places. But for young emerging designers, it can be confusing to the industry when a brand keeps swapping around.\u201d Since launching with GQ China, Xander Zhou has consistently shown at LFWM. This season, his conceptual designs exploring multiverses and inclusivity showcased a level of maturity that Lee considers integral to having a solid base. \u201cNow, after four or five years, we really know the brand,\u201d Lee says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good model for young, emerging Chinese designers to adopt.\u201d", "Xander Zhou FW20 Runway.

Ka Wa Key suggested it wasn\u2019t ideal for them, while the London-based duo Dan Shan, who are former regulars at LFWM, opted for a break, instead opting for a showroom at Pitti Immagine Uomo and a show in Shanghai. The Guangzhou-born Danxia Liu, one half of the label explains, saying, \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a better timeline to show later. Also, if you show in March or April, you have more chances of standing out. The buyers have a fresh memory.

Standing out is vital, and Asian fashion weeks have a much lower MIV impact than London: An internal report by Launchmetrics stated that across Western channels, SS20 could be valued as follows: $8.2 million in Tokyo, $5.6 million in Seoul, and $2.1 million in Shanghai. As Yu suggests, showing internationally carries \u201cprestige\u201d for Chinese designers, and in this regard, designers need to break out and compete on the global stage. \u201cChinese consumers appreciate designers who are gaining recognition abroad and are keen to support and celebrate their success,\u201d she adds. \u201cChinese designers could make this a key part of their marketing strategy.\u201d", "On the ground level, brands like Dan Shan are writing a new rulebook by being flexible. Liu is confident that when choosing where to show, brands don\u2019t have to follow pre-existing routes. \u201cThese days, it simply doesn\u2019t really matter where you show or even what time.

Their formulas which include a distinctive DNA, grass-root marketing, and constant revision of product formula due to consumer demand, are drastically different to luxury brands with who have a controlled brand image, precise merchandizing and trendsetting design. In China, homegrown brands and Taobao vendors will react to consumer brands both in design and customer service terms. Already, local brand Perfect Diary communicated with consumers and reacted to the latest social trends by dropping special editions. While luxury brands may not become entirely D2C, they can utilize their marketing strategies. User-generated content will become an irreversible trend, whether that\u2019s in customized products or social media engagement.

The answer is simple: Those brands create at least the same amount of value as the prices they charge. If a customer is willing to spend $4,000 for a Louis Vuitton or Gucci handbag or $5,000 for a Cartier ring, then those prices are the perceived values of those brands. Yes: The bag or ring\u2019s design and materials are contributing factors to their prices, but the majority of an object\u2019s value is created by the brand, not by the product\u2019s functional value or its features. Still, many brands focus predominantly on products and neglect to build brand equity. And while some might have been able to get away with that over the last decade, they won\u2019t be able to in the next one.", "The past few years have already shown a clear tendency towards ultra-premiumization, which will help push average brands out of business even faster. The average prices of the leading luxury brands in every category have significantly increased, and there\u2019s been an emergence of new brands and product lines offered at dramatically higher price points than we\u2019ve ever witnessed before. If you look at the beauty care segment, for example, the sheer number of brands priced above $500 for their main items has skyrocketed, and this was a price point that seemed unreachable just a few years ago. The lesson? When brands offer enough perceived value, consumers are willing to pay for it.", "This trend is only going to increase.

Very few brands were clear about their purpose during our recent brand audits. At best, they had a vague idea, but one that rarely translated into tangible customer benefits. A lot of brand definitions today are merely self-descriptive. In other words, the brands talk about themselves rather than the value they create for their customers.", "Even worse, if a value definition does exist, it often gets lost during customer interactions. For instance, I audited the shopping experiences of several top luxury leather goods brands last week, and the results were eye-opening: All the experiences felt the same, regardless of the brand.

Young millennials and Gen Zers will account for the majority of luxury consumption in ten years, and women will be the most important gender in making purchase decisions. These customers expect brands that resonate with them and know their preferences. Having a beautiful product won\u2019t be enough. The purpose of the brand is what will matter most. What are the values of the brand? Is the brand true to its values? Or, are the values just on paper?

Then, train your team on what luxury means in the 2020s. Even with the best brands, there is often a gap in knowledge when managing luxury in a purposeful way for millennials and Gen Zers.

According to Daniel Zipser, Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company, Leader of Greater China Consumer and Retail Practice, bags normally have English or French names that are not easy to pronounce. \u201cWith easier nicknames, people tend to talk about them more both on social media and in daily life. With Chinese nicknames, purchasers get to know the story and the uniqueness of the bag better.\u201d", "Currently, most handbag\u2019s nicknames are based on appearance, transliteration, translation or pop culture references. JW Anderson\u2019s Pierce bag was given the name, Bull Demon King Bag (\u201c\u725b\u9b54\u738b\u5305\u201d) due to its similarity in shape to a character from the Chinese Classical Novel Journey to the West, which increased the social buzz around this bag. The Drew bag, considered the most iconic design from Chlo\u00e9 in China, received the name \u201c\u5c0f\u732a\u5305\u201d for the similarity in pronunciation of Drew and the Chinese character \u201d\u732a\u201d (zh\u016b), and the similarity between the shape of the bag and a pig head. Ultimately, the goal is to make a bag easier to remember or refer to and adding more fun to the name adds even more value. But, perhaps, the biggest gain from nicknames can be seen culturally. As much luxury consumption on the mainland is socially driven, casually referring to handbags by nicknames in conversations highlights a touch of sophistication among peer groups. \u201cUsing the nickname itself shows that he or she knows the latest trend of fashion and is a luxury insider,\u201d adds Zipser.", "KOLs and Celebrity Endorsement Are Huge Drivers\u00a0", "According to the Tmall report, \u201cRankings on Chinese Celebrities in Driving Sales,\u201d in 2018 the keyword \u201ccelebrity style\u201d (\u201c\u660e\u661f\u540c\u6b3e\u201d) received over 100 million searches on Tmall.

But as is often the case in China, the road to securing a successful or iconic design is manifold. As Chinese consumers approach luxury consumption from a highly socially-driven mindset, additions to the product that adds more social value including nicknames, celebrity and KOL strategies, and user-generated content, all act as a major factor in boosting the potential success of a handbag."]}, {"title": "E-commerce vs. Brick and Mortar: Which Wins the Holiday Season?", "meta": "December 11, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Before the holiday season, marketers develop a strategy that will boost engagement and increase sales, revenues, and profits.

Boasting watches and jewelry brands such as Ulysse Nardin, Boucheron, Girard-Perregaux, and China\u2019s own Qeelin, Kering, too, is fighting an uphill battle in the segment against Richemont.", "But it\u2019s where these two benefits meet that Tiffany\u2019s strengths lie for LVMH. Although 2019 marked a decline in Chinese travelers heading to the U.S. and a slower pace of Chinese student enrollments, there are signs that both could recover in 2020. Similarly, the mid-market jewelry segment in China remains ripe for continued growth, and this sits right in Tiffany\u2019s sweet spot. This would be good news for Tiffany & Co, which has struggled with a slowdown in its home market and needs a rebound in Hong Kong to make up for a sharp drop in its 3Q earnings. But it also opens up LVMH to tap more of the Chinese middle class, which also favors the group\u2019s higher-end offerings.", "Gucci owner Kering, too, continues to focus on strategic acquisitions that could give it a stronger position in China. Most recently, it was announced that Kering is in preliminary discussions with the Italian apparel brand Moncler, whose high-priced puffer jackets are a regular sight in Beijing or Shanghai.", "As Reuters noted, \u201cA deal for Moncler would give Kering a label whose growth has stood out over the past decade, even in a booming luxury sector.

Yet, without the added legacy of traditional luxury handbag brands normally preferred in China, how exactly do these niche brands gain their share of the highly competitive handbag market?", "Firstly, in the West, emerging brands\u2019 merchandising is deeply rooted in Instagram. Admittedly, while there are limited users of the app in mainland China (it can only be accessed via the use of a VPN), labels that value their Chinese fans on the platform see more benefits. Recently, the BoF report \u201cInstagram Does Matter in China. Here\u2019s How Brands Can Use It\u201d shed light on Instagram\u2019s indispensable influence on boosting brands\u2019 presence in the mainland. Users of the app are seen as open-minded and sophisticated and are therefore not only targeted consumers but can function as the link between them and other potential followers. As well as By Far, this Instagram-focused strategy has brought success to other emerging brands such as Manu Atelier, Staud, and Cult Gaia who are also trending on social media wish-lists.", "Admittedly, it is difficult for newer labels to compete with luxury houses\u2019 billion-dollar business. However, their ability to tell stories that captivate local shoppers is helping facilitate connections with purchasers. Whereas luxury brands often struggle to react swiftly to the market, smaller businesses can adapt in real-time. Therefore, a localized and elasticated social media approach enables these designers to fully capitalize on China\u2019s highly-developed e-commerce opportunities.", "Celebrity endorsements can also significantly drive the sales of emerging designers. By Far has been expanding unexpectedly in the West thanks to \u201cIt\u201d girls Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner, and Gigi Hadid. In Asia, fans include Jennie Kim, a member of popular South Korean group Blackpink, which has a\u00a0considerable fanbase in China.\u00a0Brands similar to By Far are also tapping Chinese KOLs who have experience living overseas and are active on local social media as well as Instagram \u2014 these include Canadian-based fashion and beauty KOL @Oh_Emma, fashion blogger @Savislook, and Paris-based influencer @Gxiayan. Collaborating with such names can drive domestic and global traffic simultaneously: a gifted-handbag shared on such KOLs feeds help brands reach broader domestic consumers.", "E-commerce additionally plays a vital role in raising awareness of these niche brands and much can be attributed to overseas e-retailers such as Shopbop, Farfetch, and Net-a-Porter. These online shopping destinations customize Chinese language websites, provide convenient delivery to China and offer targeted promotions and discounts. Their Chinese-friendly features facilitate personalised storytelling while flexible return and exchange policies encourage shoppers to be daring \u2014 to try new brands not previously on their radar. Affordable luxury e-tailer Shopbop, for one, has successfully promoted emerging brands to Chinese customers. Net-A-Porter on TMALL and Moda Operandi\u2019s Mini Program now available on WeChat also offer easy access to more unusual brands.", "This flexible transition from social media to e-commerce offers labels more diverse digital solutions to infiltrate the market.

For example, WeChat\u2019s online mini-store \u201cMr. Bags with Farfetch\u201d shows that a seamless transition from browsing WeChat posts to on-site shopping (similar to Instagram\u2019s shopping feature) often increases purchases.", "Brick-and-mortar naturally plays a role too. Stockists like local department stores including Lane Crawford and independent fashion retailers across tier-1 and tier-2 cities (from Chengdu to Ningbo) means emerging brands can build an offline presence as well. Buyers familiar with their local market can go a long way in helping brands to communicate with targeted shoppers.

To further encourage purchases onsite it uses a Chinese-language option and offers product delivery; it waives international shipping fees and rewards include reposts and shout-outs on the official Weibo account. And so far, it\u2019s working: By Far has managed to establish itself as a coveted niche label.", "The identification of a \u201cniche\u201d brand is exciting to Chinese consumers yet these strategies do not result in a wider consumer base; instead, insider exclusivity is driving this niche cult.

Discreet signature styles have become invisible logos to showboat individual status.", "Handbags are not the only segment to experience a rise in appeal of niche brands. However, designers must enrich the meaning of the word in their specific sector and brands need to convince fans of the specialities of their products by foregrounding craftsmanship, quality, and small-batch production yet these attributes do not simply guarantee sales by themselves. In China, niche suggests something entirely oppositional to the popularity of \u201cIt\u201d bags and a brand that self-identifies as niche is expected to offer some additional value. Potential fans are already well-acquainted with luxury and fashion; incorporating high-quality leather, provenance, and authentic innovation into brands\u2019 storytelling is necessary to ensure they stand out in a competitive market.

A good example is a program we did with Gucci called Open House. Every two months, we rolled out new editorial content using our external talent to tell Gucci\u2019s story in their own way. Right now I feel brands need to go back and really reevaluate their online distribution. They should manage online distribution as a true extension of their D2C strategy.

Just ask Tiffany and Louis Vuitton. With more and more of China\u2019s luxury shoppers staying home to shop, Western luxury brands have been enjoying increased sales performances on the mainland. Recently, Morgan Stanley researched this phenomenon and presented their findings in an insightful report, Chinese Luxury Consumption \u2014 Reshoring Disruption. According to the investment bank, Chinese travelers\u2019 shift to less shopping-focused travel, competitive pricing and offerings, as well as improved accessibility to brands throughout China are key factors driving this latest market trend. Here, Jing Daily details four key takeaways from the report.", "As the Chinese outbound travel market matures, the destinations of Chinese travelers have been shifting from the Greater China region to other parts of the world. The report expects the market share of Chinese tourists to Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan to decline to just 33% by 2025, compared with around 50% in 2018. Instead, key Asian destinations and Europe will gain in Chinese tourists, from 25% and 9%, respectively, in 2018, to 34% and 12% by 2025. It\u2019s also worth noting that Europe has become one of the most popular destinations on the wish-list of Chinese tourists, outperforming other long-haul Western destinations like the U.S. and Australia.", "The preference of European destinations may be related to Chinese outbound travelers\u2019 changing travel agendas. According to a survey by the World Tourism Cities Federation, for Chinese outbound travelers, the purpose of shopping has declined from 44% in 2013/14 to 31% in 2017/18. The shopping budget of Chinese tourists has also decreased in major international shopping destinations. Today, Chinese outbound tourists prefer sightseeing, leisure/vacation, cultural/lifestyle experiences, and food tourism over shopping.", "In addition to China\u2019s shifting outbound travel preferences, the global harmonization of \u201cpricing\u201d and \u201cproduct offerings\u201d are additional key factors driving the flow of Chinese luxury consumers. As China has been reducing import tariffs, VAT, and postal taxes in recent years to increase domestic consumption, Western luxury brands have been consistently adjusting pricing globally to prevent arbitrage. As Jing Daily reported, Louis Vuitton cut prices in China by roughly 5%, in July 2018, followed by Gucci.", "The diminishing gaps in pricing between mainland China and in overseas tax-free markets makes traveling to these destinations to shop less attractive. Morgan Stanley compared the pricing gap with air travel/train ticket expenses and found very little difference when traveling to Asia or Europe now. Although handbags in Europe (UK, France, and Italy) are on average 27% cheaper than in China, the price gap of other luxury categories like jewelry has been significantly reduced.", "Moreover, the competitive product offerings onshore further boost domestic luxury consumption. According to the report, even though China continues to slightly lag in overall SKUs (around 15% compared to major European cities), SKUs, in terms of variety and color among popular products in China could be 5% more than in other Asian and European locations. Brands are also launching more on-time products in China. Apple, for example, has made China a key launch location for new product releases since 2015.", "The availability of luxury goods is at best uneven in China, as most of the luxury stores and malls are currently concentrated in several first-tier cities. The report, however, points out that brands are improving sale channels throughout \u00a0China \u2014\u00a0both online and offline \u2014 which will continue to drive domestic luxury consumption in China.", "The report also expects an expanding network of physical luxury malls in China and an e-commerce penetration throughout the country. Meanwhile, Western luxury brands have been improving their in-store services to increase sales performances, as well as expanding their footprint in more luxury malls beyond first-tier cities to capture more of the rising consumption potential in China\u2019s many lower-tier cities.", "And then there is the rapid development of e-commerce platforms in China, which offers both brands and consumers more shopping options. According to the report, the number of brands joining Tmall\u2019s Luxury Pavilion rose from 17 in August 2017 to 115 by \u00a0July 2019. Online platforms also offer an advantage for on-time launches. Earlier this September, both L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Shiseido announced that over 50% of the new product launches in China in the future, will be conducted through the Tmall platform. The ever-increasing penetration of luxury e-commerce throughout China offers not only a broader selection of products to potential consumers, but also yet another advantage to drive higher domestic consumption.", "According to Morgan Stanley, China\u2019s many malls are catching up to Hong Kong in retail sales, with seven mainland malls sales exceeding one-quarter of Harbour City\u2019s (one of HK\u2019s key luxury malls) retail sales in 2018. Additionally, China\u2019s duty-free stores, as one of the important luxury shopping destinations, have also been driving the reshoring of Chinese luxury consumption.", "The Hong Kong luxury retail market relies heavily on Chinese tourists; however, this \u201cshopping paradise\u201d has been losing market share among first-time outbound Chinese travelers even before the protests \u2014\u00a0the amount spent shopping from overnight Chinese visitors to Hong Kong has declined 33% from HK$6.4K per person in 2013 to HK$4.3K per person in 2018. The report estimated that, with the influence of ongoing violent protests in the city, Hong Kong\u2019s tourism and luxury retail market will be structurally challenged.

For older generations, on the other hand, it\u2019s the opposite: They emulate the tastes of their kids or other younger people.

That\u2019s because the next generation, Gen Z, is already starting to join the market, and they are crucial in helping to drive brand preferences for millennials in their 30s. As a rule, brands need to start much earlier and appeal to high schoolers and young college students.", "The success stories of Gucci, Supreme, Off-White, and Balenciaga are cases in point. They\u2019ve mastered connecting with consumers in their late teens, and this, in turn, makes them relevant to older target groups, including millennials.

Luxury is always a result of social currency, and only brands that are seen as relevant by younger customers will thrive while those that don\u2019t risk becoming obsolete (which, as mentioned earlier, happens fast).", "Find the perfect story", "To appeal to Gen Zers, a brand\u2019s storytelling is crucial. Brands need to put their focus on building brand equity \u2014 in other words, forming clear rational and emotional positions about what the brand stands for.

If they don\u2019t quickly get what\u2019s in for them (i.e. why the brand should matter to them or what value the brand provides them), they simply won\u2019t be interested. Sometimes managers ask me, \u201cHow can we get more authentic?\u201d They ask that because brands will only resonate if they are authentic. And since a brand\u2019s story is the driver of authenticity, regular brand audits and critical evaluations of a brand\u2019s storytelling are indispensable.", "Brand storytelling is not primarily about advertising, which is a common misconception. In its most elemental form, it\u2019s the way a brand creates value. Everything the brand does needs to follow the brand story: at each consumer touchpoint and with each product. All actions should be seen as part of the delivery system for the brand story. Brands that are weak in storytelling will never be perceived as authentic and relevant, and they won\u2019t be able to create luxury value and sustain their market position. Brand storytelling describes what the brand sells \u2014 both rationally and emotionally. It must be much more distinct than what everyone else in the category does and much more precise than simply claiming to \u201csell a dream.\u201d Cliches like this mean nothing to consumers.", "The message must be digital", "To deliver these stories, digital capabilities are critical. Most brands lack in most CRM (customer relationship management) capabilities, and even if they have a system, it\u2019s not connected and efficient enough to support personalized customer interactions. But going even deeper, most brands lack IRM (influencer relationship management) systems, which help identify and engage with necessary KOLs and influencers. Not having those capabilities is deadly, because younger consumers \u2014 particularly in China \u2014 are more receptive to people than brands. Therefore, key opinion consumers who influence their peers and followers need to be managed as precisely as any other brand element. It\u2019s important that influencers accurately reflect a brand\u2019s storytelling to help create consistency.", "And finally, many brands also lack real-time consumer insights, which are necessary for management teams\u2019 daily decision making. To glean these insights, a brand needs artificial intelligence to process the big data it\u2019s constantly receiving. Today, insights from traditional market research studies are too slow and imprecise, and thereby, in most cases, they\u2019re irrelevant.", "The good news is that rapid change can provide incredible opportunities for brands, but only if they\u2019re properly prepared. In luxury, the youngest consumers have to come first since they influence all the other generations before them. Thus, different thinking beyond one\u2019s comfort zone is imperative.

Instead, they need to tell their customers what unique value they create specifically for them by the things they do exceptionally well.", "In luxury, it\u2019s about them (customer-centricity), not us (internal capabilities). Exceptional craftsmanship only creates value if there is a perceivable distinction between other luxury brands, and if this distinction can be expressed as a value proposition towards the customer.

Both are important and need to be a consistent part of the brand story. Few brands, however, have clarity around their emotional core, their purpose, and the way how they inspire their customers. What I often see is that they express, as their emotional positioning, the creation of dreams. The problem with this is: Unless the dream is explicitly defined, it seldom will create any customer value, and it won\u2019t differentiate the brand. More precision is needed.", "As a result, we typically find brands that are talking to themselves about themselves and in an imprecise way, and not differentiating enough from their competitors.

Macro factors, such as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and China\u2019s economic slowdown, have helped shape this new landscape. Statistics show that the number of tourists coming from China dropped for the first time in 15 years, even though total outbound trips by Chinese tourists still rose significantly.", "Meanwhile, multiple U.S.-based brands like Tiffany & Co., Capri Holdings Ltd.

What\u2019s key for retailers right now is understanding exactly how these macro factors have influenced their businesses and how they can adapt accordingly. But alas, there are many reasons why the U.S. can no longer rely on Chinese travelers for growth. Below are Jing Daily\u2019s top-7 reasons:", "1. The Chinese economic slowdown", "China\u2019s economic growth fell to its slowest pace in nearly three decades this July. Even though China\u2019s economy is still growing each year by the size of the Australian economy, that growth is slowing down significantly, and that has undoubtedly had an impact on overseas consumer spending. Today, consumption now accounts for over half of China\u2019s economy, but spending is decreasing and shifting \u2014 more spending is on services but not goods.", "2. The continued depreciation of the Chinese yuan", "Since August, the Chinese yuan fell by over 1.6 percent to 7.108 against the U.S. dollar, hitting a low last seen in 2008 (and it continues to drop as we speak.) This has weakened Chinese travelers\u2019 spending power, and those who used to spend freely in the U.S. may now consider alternatives in nearby countries, such as Japan and North Korea, particularly for the upcoming Golden Week holiday. The Chinese government\u2019s fix in currency makes Chinese goods cheaper and more attractive and is a response to Trump\u2019s tariff threats. It shows that Chinese policymakers are determined to take a tougher stance during these trade disputes, so retailers should expect the currency swing to continue.", "3. China\u2019s narrowed price gaps", "In April, the Chinese government reduced the value-added tax to three percent (varies depending on the industry), proving its eagerness to redirect overseas Chinese consumption back into the mainland. As a result, luxury fashion labels like Louis Vuitton and Gucci slashed their retail prices in mainland China. This is a trend that\u2019s already a few years old, and retailers should expect price gaps to keep narrowing.", "4. The loss of international Chinese students due to tougher visa policies", "Some luxury retailers in the U.S. had been boosted by the country\u2019s strong international Chinese student population, however, as the current administration continues to tighten visa regulations, it has become harder for students and their families to invest in a U.S. education in the hope to become an immigrant. Many of them are now turning to countries like Canada or Australia as alternatives. A 2018 survey by the Institute of International Education (a non-profit research group based in New York) showed that nearly half of the 540 higher education respondents reported a decline in new Chinese enrollments. Because of this, local luxury retailers could suffer in the short-term.", "5. The rise of Chinese brands", "As China transitions from a manufacturing economy to a consumption one, we\u2019re starting to see the rise of home-grown brands. Luxury brands might not have any direct competitors just yet, but Chinese fashion brands \u2014 particularly premium female brands like Erdos, Marisfrolg, and Mo&Co \u2014 have grabbed a sizable share of the market. They\u2019ve done this by catering to younger Chinese consumers who take pride in products that are \u201cmade in China\u201d as well as middle-class consumers who look for solid value in their purchases and are less interested in chasing big-name foreign brands.", "6. \u2028Brands are embracing digital channels in China", "Today, brands are looking for other ways to branch into the local Chinese market. For example, instead of opening new brick-and-mortar stores, U.S. retailers like & Other stories and the D2C brand Everlane have decided to open official stores on the Chinese online retail sales site Tmall. These smaller brands are increasingly opening e-commerce stores in China that connect to Chinese consumers\u2019 favorite payment methods, Alipay and WeChat pay, as a more efficient way to make sales in the country.", "7. \u2028Affluent Chinese travelers now prefer experiential travel to shopping", "Meanwhile, the affluent Chinese travelers whose wealth is less impacted by the current climate and are less-price conscious, have undergone a consumption transformation of their own. Research shows that the new breed of Chinese tourist is spending more \u2014 20 percent of luxury travelers have spent over $70,000 (500,000 yuan) on tourism and the number of Chinese High Net Worth Individuals has risen nearly 9 times in the last decade. But these tourists now prefer to spend their money learning about various cultures as opposed to investing in name-brand luxury objects.

Furthermore, younger Chinese consumers demand exposure in the digital realm, but this ubiquity hurts the exclusiveness of the brand.", "Given the complexity of the market, many international brands have failed in China. Some fizzled because they became too experiential, while others because they maintained their high class appeal without opening to the general public. But there are also heritage brands like Herm\u00e8s and Dior that have balanced exclusivity and ubiquity by employing heritage marketing strategies. In fact, former Herm\u00e8s CEO, Patrick Thomas,\u00a0put things into perspective by saying: \u201cThe luxury industry is built on a paradox: the more desirable the brand becomes, the more it sells, but the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes.\u201d Indeed, this paradox dictates the rules of engagement; thus, communicating a brand\u2019s legacy without overexposing the brand in the digital sphere has become a continuous struggle.", "For younger Chinese consumers the dive in luxury comes through digital technologies. And luxury conglomerates like Kering and LVMH use high-tech options to communicate their heritage, aesthetics, craftsmanship, and history. Incorporating augmented reality, virtual reality, and data-backed strategies doesn\u2019t indicate that we will overlook the heritage feature. On the contrary, these modern communication technologies are used to convey the winning qualities of a brand.", "As mentioned above, luxury brands need to communicate their legacy if they want to build a long lasting relationship with their consumer base. Clearly, the digital world provides the tools for building engagement. Brands like Herm\u00e8s, Dior, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton are doing an excellent job in China. Not only that, they use digital storytelling to communicate their craftsmanship and value, but they also develop engaging experiences that link online and offline channels. In other words, a successful heritage marketing strategy requires the strengthening of the brand equity and this is done by fully leveraging the power of social media platforms. Moreover, successful luxury brands use digital technology to create connections that are culturally relevant to the audience. Basically, rather than reinventing new marketing strategies, these companies build on their cultural patrimony, readapting the message to the local audience.", "As an example, LVMH-backed Cha Ling has done a great job at merging the heritage and know-how of the French luxury conglomerate with Chinese values and expertise. Consequently, Chinese consumers saw Cha Ling as a brand that uplifts its own qualities (including the heritage component) by acknowledging Eastern cultural values. Furthermore, at no point in time, does Cha Ling or LVMH ridicule Chinese values by employing a subordinate-superior relationship in which European heritage and craftsmanship become principal assets, but rather it venerates the rich Chinese history, transforming it into the company\u2019s greatest equity. In contrast, Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s tone-deaf Eating with Chopsticks campaign proves how an European brand that is too focused on its own history (think the \u201cItalianit\u00e0\u201d promoted by Dolce\u00a0& Gabbana) becomes unusually rigid in its marketing strategy and incapable to embrace and understand foreign cultural elements.", "Dropping an ill-advised marketing campaign on the luxury audience can have devastating outcomes. This applies in particular to China, a country with a uniquely rich culture, history, and philosophy. Moreover, the one-size-fits-all marketing approach trivializes the host culture while slaughtering any form of dialogue and engagement with local consumers. Brands that understand the importance of traditions and heritage in China perpetuate engagement. For example, in January 2019, a mall in Guangzhou \u201chosted a candy and snack fair themed on the Qing Dynasty.\u201d Hsu Fu Chi International Limited organized the fair to kick off the marketing campaign for the Chinese Lunar New Year.", "Hsu Fu Chi International Limited\u00a0is a Chinese candy producer that became world famous in 2011 when Nestl\u00e9 Group\u00a0paid $1.7 billion for a 60 percent stake in the company. Since entering in a partnership agreement with the world\u2019s largest food company, Hsu Fu Chi International Limited\u00a0maintained its prime position on the Chinese market through clever marketing campaigns that leveraged the power of heritage marketing. China Daily says that: \u201cWith television serials about the Qing Dynasty period, such as The Story of Yanxi Palace and Ruyi\u2019s Royal Love in the Palace proving popular among the younger generation last year, Hsu Fu Chi has developed a series of royalty-and palace-themed entertainment content and gift packs.\u201d", "Evidently,\u201cemphasizing popular traditional elements\u201d is a successful marketing strategy. In this case, the brand crafts an engaging story around an exclusive world giving its consumer base the premise to start a conversation. And then again, by engaging buyers, the brand builds a long-lasting emotional connection.", "And yet despite Cha Ling and Hsu Fu Chi\u2019s success and the long history of heritage and craft traditions\u00a0in China, few domestic brands replicated the Western heritage model. Given the fact that heritage commodification implies a certain pride in one\u2019s national, historic, and cultural values, and China has just recently revived nationalism and patriotic education, we should expect more national brands to follow suit in the upcoming year. Ultimately, heritage marketing will aid domestic brands in their efforts to outperform international players in China."]}, {"title": "How to Make Young Chinese Fall in Love with Your Luxury Brand", "meta": "August 26, 2019", "paragraphs": ["When I do luxury leadership seminars for luxury brands, I usually ask participants to answer the questions: What is your favorite luxury brand and what makes this brand particularly luxurious?

They indicate important new dimensions for luxury, and they provide important action areas for brands so they can avoid becoming obsolete in this fast-paced market.", "Luxury is love", "One female seminar participant started talking about her cherished Herm\u00e8s bag.

She described the purchase as \u201cfalling in love,\u201d and that she couldn\u2019t help but buy the bag.", "This is one of the most powerful insights about luxury. When luxury is love, brands enter into a love relationship with their customers. Luxury can become very much like a romantic relationship, and it\u2019s up to brands to nurture, strengthen, and maintain that relationship. If it becomes routine, the relationship can easily cool off, and the customer will move on to another brand. Even worse, if customers feel they were cheated, they won\u2019t leave silently. Instead, their love will turn to hate. They will break things off, often publicly, and will tell all their friends about their broken love.", "To avoid this, companies should conduct customer journey audits and rigorously identify what can go wrong and where. Only then can a brand take care of customer-related issues as they come up. By not taking care, they provoke a hard exit, and even being slow to respond gives the customer the impression that they\u2019re not important, which compounds an issue. Excellent service can actually strengthen a customer bond, but failing to offer service can spell disaster in the end.", "Luxury is the ability to influence, innovate, and inspire", "One seminar participant mentioned Gucci, saying that the reason she finds the brand intriguing is its ability to \u201cinfluence, innovate, and inspire.\u201d She saw the brand as disruptive, surprising, and very energetic. She also felt that Gucci was like \u201chome\u201d for her, as the brand is for people who are young and rebellious.", "Luxury should never be boring. Pietro Beccari, the CEO of Dior, once said that luxury is \u201cpure emotion.\u201d This is a great way of stating that luxury brands need to be able to stimulate change. When consumers see a brand doing this, they are drawn to its authenticity and energy. This explains, in part, why Gucci and Dior are among the most successful luxury brands among Millennials and Gen Zers, despite their long histories.", "Always remember that luxury is there to provide unique experiences. Unique means that it cannot be repeated. Therefore, being seen as innovative and influential is of the utmost importance to a luxury brand. The perpetual management of surprise is an essential task for connecting with young consumers. Therefore, when brands play it safe, it quickly becomes the kiss of death.", "Luxury lets you reconnect and recharge", "Well-being is one of the most underestimated aspects of luxury. When people buy luxuries, they\u2019re also buying an escape from the routine of day-to-day life. It allows them to disconnect from their problems and reconnect with their true selves. Because of this, luxury \u2018experiences\u2019 are of utmost importance. Luxury is an end-to-end experience, and the task of luxury brands is to make people feel good and encounter something they could never find anywhere else. In its ultimate form, luxury offers this with the highest possible degree of personalization and individualization.", "Luxury brands need to have a brand-distinct experience strategy, and their branded experience needs to be delivered rigorously and consistently with each customer interaction. This is where most brands fail. Most traditional luxury brands provide comparable experiences. In other words, if you take out the logo, you won\u2019t know which store you\u2019re in. The same goes for luxury hotels. Most of them are the same. From check-in to check-out, the experience is predictable and interchangeable, and when this happens, the experience will not be memorable, special, or luxurious. Luxury brands need to provide a reason for consumers to come and visit. Providing nice architecture or a beautifully designed store isn\u2019t enough. Those things are expected in luxury, but they aren\u2019t the differentiators.", "To differentiate, brands must be clear about who they are. This sounds banal, but it isn\u2019t. The CEO of a U.S.-based luxury fashion brand told me some months ago that what makes them special is that they sell \u201cdreams and experiences.\u201d But, in reality, all luxury brands do that. A brand needs to be specific about which dream it sells and which experience. It needs to be defined in every marketing detail, it has to be actionable for every staff member, and surely it has to do something different than what any other brand is doing. And, most importantly, when there is an identity mismatch, customers are indicating that the brand experience isn\u2019t projecting correctly and needs to be fixed.", "The time for complacency is over", "The Chinese luxury market has recently grown by 20% despite many insisting it no longer had any growth potential. Meanwhile, the expectations of the county\u2019s youngest customers are higher than ever. They interact with brands both digitally and in stores. This requires a dramatically new way of thinking. The best practice five years ago means nothing today. Real-time, data-driven, consumer insight tools that support a rigorous strategy execution are crucial.", "But one aspect that\u2019s often neglected is people. All it takes is one negative touchpoint to damage a customer\u2019s relationship with a brand. That\u2019s why training people is critical. And yet, few brands excel here. It\u2019s not enough to provide a brand manual or do occasional training. Proper luxury training must include fundamental insights about luxury and make clear what the role of each individual is in providing the branded luxury experience.

According to Forbes, Hong Kong accounts for 11 percent of Richemont\u2019s total global sales, while the city accounts for 9 percent of Burberry\u2019s sales, 8 percent of Kering\u2019s, and 6 percent of LVMH\u2019s. It also provides around 6 percent of total sales for brands like Moncler, Tod\u2019s, and Prada, driven primarily by purchases from mainland Chinese day-trippers or tourist shoppers.", "One of the biggest question marks for major brands is what the long-term effects of the ongoing Hong Kong protests will be. While Hong Kong will always be a major market for luxury brands, they are undoubtedly feeling the sting of store closures due to mainland Chinese shoppers opting to do their high-end shopping in other cities. And the lingering sense of uncertainty about how long the protests will last certainly isn\u2019t helping matters.", "L\u2019Occitane Vice-Chairman Andre Hoffmann recently summarized the situation by saying, \u201cHong Kong has been challenging\u2026 We lost several trading days in the quarter due to the protests. Chinese tourists spending in our shops has declined. All these are a bad cocktail for our business.\u201d But some brands have made their prospects in the city even murkier thanks to badly timed scandals that have forced them to make very public apologies in mainland China (these include Versace, Coach, Givenchy, and Swarovski, which all recently produced luxury items or marketing campaigns that \u201churt the feelings\u201d of Chinese authorities.) For Hong Kong natives who sympathize with the protests, the perception that brands are actively groveling to Beijing at this time could also leave a mark that lasts long past the current protests.", "But Hong Kong is just one area where brands are in the dark right now. Luxury brands face big questions in mainland China caused by a slowing economy and a recent currency devaluation \u2014 both primarily caused by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Most brands will likely need to raise prices in mainland China to account for a devalued yuan, and with no sense of certainty that the yuan won\u2019t continue to lose value, brands will be less likely to invest in store renovations and cosmetics brands will likely think twice before investing in new products aimed at the China market.", "Meanwhile, the future of the outbound Chinese tourist shopper \u2014 whose high-end hauls have arguably powered the luxury market over the last decade \u2014 is another question mark during this year of uncertainty. Although Chinese shoppers continue to travel and spend, where they\u2019re doing it is changing quickly. While Japan expects a solid year of Chinese tourist arrivals and purchases, the outlook is less than stellar in Thailand, and the U.S. is expecting a particularly large decline in Chinese arrivals and shopping that could stretch on for months to come. So the question for brands wanting to cater to this demographic becomes: Where should they focus their efforts?", "Brands must also reckon with a general decline in Western brand dominance in China, particularly among the country\u2019s younger shoppers. Although it is far too early to say whether or not local high-end brands can fully supplant the entrenched luxury players in China, competition is increasing in this market. As the New York Times\u00a0noted in its overview of Alibaba\u2019s recent financial results, \u201cAnalysts say the trade war with the United States has prompted shoppers to become more selective, and many have switched to buying domestic brands that they feel are of high quality.\u201d Particularly in the cosmetics and skincare market, Western brands in China face stiff competition from agile, digitally savvy brands from South Korea, Japan and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 even China itself.", "Now the open question for most major brands is how to approach the Greater China market \u2014 Hong Kong in particular \u2014 over the rest of 2019 and 2020. As many luxury commentators see it, regardless of how long the protests last, the status of Hong Kong as a financial, hospitality, luxury, and fashion epicenter has been altered; but the degree to which it\u2019s been altered remains to be seen. While some say this summer\u2019s protests mean that it\u2019s time for corporate businesses to \u201cstick a fork\u201d in Hong Kong, others are more cautious, pointing out that Hong Kong is a large city and the protests, while hugely significant and sizeable, are still limited to specific parts of the city and are limited in their disruption.", "The type of sentiment that says Hong Kong is finished as a major business center and will lose ground to Singapore likely takes too short a view of the city\u2019s history. While this summer\u2019s protests have perhaps been the longest and most violent in the recent past (as compared to the \u201cUmbrella Revolution\u201d of 2014), major brands will likely face some short-term pain but a long-term outlook that ultimately settles back to where it was at the beginning of the year (in other words, a less prosperous yet still significant \u2018normal\u2019).", "A long-term decline in sales in Hong Kong would be less due to mainland Chinese tourists\u2019 fear of protests than it would factors like how well the Chinese economy is doing overall, including the general appetite for luxury travel and shopping. As such, brands shouldn\u2019t \u2014 and likely won\u2019t \u2014 make immediate plans to pull back their Hong Kong investments or presence. Some businesses, particularly those in the hospitality market, are historically too invested in the market to ever cut back there anyway. The most likely course ahead is that brands will try and stay under the radar and limit their revenue damage as much as possible while they wait for things to settle into the new normal. In essence, the luxury market in Hong Kong is not \u201cdone\u201d by any means, even if it looks poised for a weak 2019 that could bleed into 2020."]}, {"title": "Spain\u2019s El Corte Ingl\u00e9s Shows Retailers How to \u201cTango\u201d With Chinese Shoppers", "meta": "August 15, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Founded in Madrid in 1940, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s is the largest department store chain in Europe and third largest in the world.

And after a week at R3, I was amazed how much I learned about myself , and also how much I didn\u2019t know about personal training, although I\u2019ve always had trainers and the advice from nutritionists in the past. One week can be life changing, and this is why some of the most discerning and demanding people increasingly chose offers like these.", "Traditional high-end fitness chains, like the successful Pure Fitness studios in Hong Kong have offered to train with a personal trainer for many years. Large fitness centers sometimes employ dozens of trainers, who accompany the members while they workout in the gym, often with hundreds of others in a crowded space. However, this almost commoditized the traditional personal training experience, and some conscious customers are looking for more in order\u00a0to achieve their individual objectives.", "To set themselves apart, and to get to the ultimate level of a luxury experience, customers of new ultra-customized places like R3 experience something completely different \u2014\u00a0to have a gym completely for themselves, to train in total privacy, with one dedicated trainer. When I asked Douglas Pieterse, a legend among personal trainers in Hong Kong and China and\u00a0co-founder and head\u00a0trainer of R3, why customers come to the place, he explained to me that they seek the ultimate customization. A program that is designed around their\u00a0truly individual goals, which includes all aspects of their lives. Instead of focusing on the fitness aspect alone, Douglas goes beyond and works holistically with his clients, who also include CEOs of large companies in Hong Kong and regional celebrities.", "They come for reasons like increasing their energy while mastering stressful jobs, their travel schedule, and the social commitments and family that come with them. Some are concerned about their health, others want to lose weight, look better, or simply get stronger. And many do look for the ultimate status symbol, to have not only a personal trainer, but to be coached in the most individual way according to what they really want to achieve. This includes aspects like nutrition coaching, sleep, lifestyle choices, and uniquely personalized training that take the individual composition and preferences into consideration. An important aspect is not having to share the gym with other people but enjoy an exclusive, private experience, which gives high-level clientele the rare opportunity of me-time. For many, it translates to the ultimate well-being experience.", "Personalization in luxury is becoming increasingly important in China and beyond. Brands like Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci have offered one-offs or limited editions for years and used this for differentiation and to appeal to their highest end clientele. In fashion, the ultimate expression is Haute Couture, where there is one piece, tailor-made for the customer, sometimes by dozens of highly artistic craftsmen and tailors.", "This concept now emerges into the service industry. And very few service companies have truly embraced it so far. The idea of personalized well-being has a dramatic business potential. Restaurants, hotels, travel agencies, hairdressers, spas would have the opportunity to create an ultra-luxury segment, that is completely personalized, but few companies have developed convincing concepts so far.", "One of the challenges is to create a brand positioning and a brand story that clearly communicates the difference to a standard offer and that differentiates from other high-end competitors. And since such personalized services have to create extreme value, the story can\u2019t be just rational or descriptive, it has to combine rational and emotional elements: customers have to perceive the brand purpose. When I work with brands on that aspect, I find that this is usually the biggest weakness.", "A second important aspect is the definition of a meticulously designed customer journey that is prefect in every detail. Each customer touch point counts. Most brands struggle to provide a service that highly discerning luxury consumers expect. This is why so many lose customers over time. When working with luxury brands, I try to shift their thinking from product focus, in this case providing a specific service, to a customer journey focus, providing a specific experience. Few companies excel here, however the customer journey is a precondition to win and to be able to deliver extreme customer value over time.\u00a0And no matter how big a brand is, take the example of R3 \u2014 the use of digital means and tools can and will support a winning customer journey and exclusive experience especially when it comes to the millennials.", "Well-being is the new luxury. As such, personalized concierge services emerge and luxury brands, especially in the service sector, can tap into this market if they do it fast and, most importantly, if they do it right.

Sales in mainland China are anticipated to rise 18 to 20 percent in 2019 at steady exchange prices.", "Last November, Beijing increased the tax-free allowance on personal international e-commerce purchases from 2,000 to 5,000 yuan per year, a move that aimed at increasing local purchases. This followed the move in July of last year to halve import tariffs on clothing and accessories to 7 percent, down from nearly 16 percent, and tariffs on cosmetics to just under 3 percent, down from over 8 percent, led to major luxury brands cutting mainland China prices.", "This momentum should also drive efficiency across the Asia-Pacific region (where sales are expected to rise at constant exchange rates by 10 to 12 percent this year, excluding Japan and mainland China).", "Second, the general forecast is that a plateauing Chinese economy and ongoing US-China trade tensions are unlikely to affect overall Chinese consumer luxury spending. What has\u00a0changed is where these customers are shopping.", "Kering\u2019s revenue in North America is being impacted by a decrease in Asian (in general) and Chinese (in particular) arrivals. Meanwhile, markets in Asia remain buoyant, led by South Korea, Macau and Hong Kong \u2014 although we can expect to see Hong Kong sales impacted in the second and third quarters of 2019 by protests in Hong Kong. Another area of perhaps unexpected growth this year is from mainland Chinese customers shopping at home \u2014 something that they\u2019ve traditionally been less apt to do because of high import taxes.", "These moves appear to be bearing fruit. In the first half of 2019, mainland China saw the strongest growth in the Asia-Pacific region for Kering, with sales up 35.3 percent year-on-year, reflecting the trend of more Chinese luxury consumers choosing to shop locally rather than overseas.

According to the report, for three consecutive years Chinese males from the city Henan represented the fastest growth rate in purchasing beauty products, followed by males in Shandong and Guangdong.

How do they know what within their favored brand was a \u201chot\u201d item? Conversely, how can companies understand what is trending in China versus what is fading? How can they identify sentiment? And how can they see the early warning signs that consumers are losing interest in a particular item?", "Traditionally, Western companies have relied heavily on market research surveys. An iconic luxury brand recently told me about their experiences with these studies in China. In short, they called them a disaster. They tried surveying customers in China using conventional market research methods, but they generated almost no actionable insights, and they weren\u2019t sure if the results were even relevant, because they couldn\u2019t cover enough cities in China. They received results, but they didn\u2019t know if those results were representative at all. It was a slow process that didn\u2019t allow for changes in the sentiment or trends.

It was reported that Takashima lost money in China in the three years before its departure \u2014 a closure that was estimated to have cost them approximately $30 million. In an article on June 28, 2019, the South China Morning Post cited a spokesperson of Takashima who said, \u201cRapid changes in the consumption structure and fierce industry competition have exceeded our expectations.\u201d Like others, they were too slow to generate insights into the rapidly changing consumer sentiment/habits/trends in the Chinese market. By the time they understood what was happening, it was too late.", "I am confronted with stories like these almost daily. Companies do not invest in an appropriate operating model for China. Many believe they can launch in China with approaches similar to the ones they use in other regions and fail as a result. The ultra-dynamic, vast, and fast-changing Chinese market requires a sophisticated, data-driven management approach. While many companies talk about digitization, very few are applying it sufficiently today. Most have a standard CRM and use basic social media listening tools, however, very few companies build an infrastructure that offers them actionable insights created from available data. This is where AI is a game-changer.", "It is important to note here that A.I. is an often-overused term.

Most importantly, the company\u2019s entire data infrastructure needs to be structured in a way that connects all data sources so relationships between them can be identified and understood.", "But why exactly is AI so important, and how can luxury brands apply it in China? Imagine this typical challenge many luxury companies face: A luxury brand in China has an aging consumer profile and isn\u2019t appealing to Millennials and Gen Zers. Its flagship stores in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong don\u2019t have enough foot traffic and can\u2019t generate enough revenue to cover their costs. Brand loyalty is decreasing, and market shares are eroding. What needs to be done?", "This is where many companies simply rely on gut feeling. They may switch their advertising agency, run promotions that just erode brand equity, or try out new campaigns or influencers. They may even develop a WeChat Mini Program. But, if they lack fundamental insights on what\u2019s wrong with the branding, there is a high probability that all those measures will change nothing or even compound their problems.", "Instead, a company should use machine learning and a sophisticated AI engine to analyze all available data points, including the millions of conversations consumers have about the brand online, which can be challenging because of the firewalled Chinese internet. Afterward, the brand should understand the precise consumer sentiment about itself, and, more importantly, the changes in that sentiment over time. This analysis goes beyond simple social media listening because it gathers data across several brand touchpoints (from store foot traffic to online sales) to create a model of how changes in sentiment impact purchase patterns. Only then can a brand identify the real reasons for its negative performance, which could be anything from weak brand positioning to inefficient communication campaigns. Only then can a company develop precise strategies to strengthen its brand and its performance while also identifying significant marketing savings and efficiency gains.", "China is one of the most attractive markets for luxury brands today, but it is also one of the most challenging.

Below, Jing Daily breaks down the five major reasons behind Louis Vuitton\u2019s runaway success and where they can improve in the future:", "1. A strong focus on younger consumers", "In the past few years, Louis Vuitton began reaching out to millennials and Gen Zers, which turned out to be a brilliant money-making idea. In the not-too-distant past, heritage brands only wanted to be associated with excess wealth and privilege. But today\u2019s luxury is more inclusive and less hostile. By collaborating with streetwear brands (Supreme), partnering with young influencers (Selena Gomez, Karlie Kloss, and Emma Chamberlain), and building an online presence that connects with younger consumers, Louis Vuitton has created a global uproar while rewriting the rules of audience engagement in this booming marketplace.", "Their digital performance is especially striking. With 7.38 million Twitter followers and 33 million Instagram followers, Louis Vuitton is leading the social media revolution globally and is proving that a heritage brand can be savvy with social media. While some heritage brands (Chanel) have remained highly inaccessible, Louis Vuitton continues to break new ground with social media engagement \u2014 an attitude that\u2019s atypical for luxury brands, who are often slow to engage with consumers online. Specific to China, Louis Vuitton attracted younger customers by highlighting streetwear collaborations and leveraging the power of KOLs in that country. Choosing rapper and television celebrity Kris Wu as their brand ambassador was an audacious move that sent both fans and haters into a frenzy while allowing social media conversations about the brand to thrive.", "2. Embracing digital innovation", "For all the talk about embracing digital innovation, most luxury brands have taken a slower approach to that change, and several luxury houses still haven\u2019t integrated consistent digital brand experiences. Yet, according to Digimind, a global social media intelligence company, 93 percent of consumer engagement with luxury brands takes place on Instagram, and 40 percent of luxury purchases are influenced \u2014 to a certain degree \u2014 by online content. So why haven\u2019t brands moved faster to digital? It seems as if many still don\u2019t know how to create a personalized digital experience or maintain a digital storefront that can generate traffic or sales. In contrast, Louis Vuitton is a digital pioneer, having just recently created a WeChat Mini Program specifically for the launch of their Virgil Abloh-designed sneakers.", "3. Stricter control of distribution channels", "Louis Vuitton has remained cautious with their distribution rights, and this vigilance has benefited the brand in the long run. Eventually, if a luxury house expands excessively (as Gucci has, for instance), it hurts the brand\u2019s overall status and value. Ralph Lauren is the perfect example of this. Due to international licensing agreements and aggressive sales policies, the brand lost much of its original identity and \u2018snooty\u201d appeal in China. Despite the fact that brands can now reach more potential consumers than ever, the allure of luxury is all about its exclusivity, and no one wants to invest in a widely available premium item. Louis Vuitton fans know that the brand doesn\u2019t have sales or a wholesale policy for department stores. Because of this, Louis Vuitton keeps their production and pricing in check, therefore, always maintaining their high-end appeal.", "4. Streamlining China operations", "According to the South China Morning Post, Louis Vuitton streamlined China operations \u201cto create a better consumer experience and improve margins.\u201d Michael Burke, Chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, says that Louis Vuitton closed eight stores in China but refurbished their existing ones. Moreover, all stores were supplied with full merchandise lines, including the highly coveted pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter collections.", "5. Staying in front of product trends", "According to a statement from Louis Vuitton, their Fashion and Leather Goods department \u201cdelivered an exceptional performance\u201d in 2018. A lot of that is because, through artistic collaborations (like the one with contemporary artist Jeff Koons in 2017, for instance), Louis Vuitton has resurrected iconic leather accessories, with younger consumers now enthusiastically embracing those products.", "Additionally, Louis Vuitton decided to take the customization trend a step further by starting their \u201cNow Yours Run Away\u201d personalization program for sneakers in October 2018. Since authenticity and self-expression are important to China\u2019s younger consumers, they like influencing the design process of the products they buy. This is why the customization trend responds well to their needs. In this case, Louis Vuitton found a balanced blueprint for success by adapting a long-selling product with strict considerations for quality and design to resonate with younger consumers.", "What then is next for Louis Vuitton in China? They supposedly will continue to invest in cross-channel customer experiences. But if the French luxury house is serious about keeping its pole position, it must stay relevant. WeChat and Douyin have become great marketing platforms in China, but Louis Vuitton needs to find new, innovative ways to reach their consumer base. Furthermore, one issue that remains is finding a balance between the brand\u2019s heritage and these types of innovation.", "Louis Vuitton is a digitally-minded forerunner in the field, but mature consumers might distance themselves from the brand because of overexposure. While the French luxury house is doing a great job at building awareness and talking to Gen Zers and millennials, they seem to be overlooking the potential of the mature consumers who have been their staunch supporters in the past. This is a heritage brand that moved from ads starring 20th-century titans like Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Francis Ford Coppola to instead featuring video game characters and teenagers in their campaigns. The future of Louis Vuitton depends on keeping younger generations of consumers around without neglecting their loyal, mature luxury buyers. Speaking to different niche groups one-on-one is the solution.", "In short, Louis Vuitton needs to discover new growth opportunities without damaging the reputation of the brand. Managing brand exposure in the new global economy is a real balancing act, but no brand is better positioned to walk this tightrope than the luxury market\u2019s reigning champ."]}, {"title": "Dunhill Set to Expand in China Travel Retail Market", "meta": "July 26, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Richemont-owned luxury brand Alfred Dunhill is primed for expansion in the Asia Pacific travel retail market, helped by a strong showing in online brand ranking tables following the recent 2020 spring/summer men\u2019s fashion show season.", "The Moodie Davitt Report is reliably informed that the luxury brand is gearing up for further development through the rebuilding of its travel retail team and expansion of its network in Asia.

And this is particularly true when speaking of customers buying luxury bags.\u201d It\u2019s clear that individuality and self-expression are important for younger demographics, and Chinese millennials and Gen-Zers glorify luxury brands that respect their individuality and respond to their peculiar needs. Since the primary in-demand quality of a heritage brand is \u2018exclusivity,\u2019 most luxury buyers have become less enthusiastic about mass production. Consequently, younger consumers want to be involved in the design process by leaving their mark on the end product.", "A 2015 research paper from Deloitte named \u201cThe Deloitte Consumer Review. Made-to-order: The rise of mass personalization\u201d states that 36 percent of consumers are interested in buying personalized products while 48 percent don\u2019t mind waiting longer for customized luxury goods.

What makes a millennial spend more?\u201d shows that 40.6 percent of Chinese millennial consumers don\u2019t mind paying a premium for a personalized product, while in the U.S., 71.4 percent would pay a premium. This shows how popular customized luxury goods have become around the world and how this trend still has room for growth in China.", "It should be noted here that a correlation between fashion styles and the economy is often recognized. Some retail experts argue that in times of recession, trendsetters embrace conspicuous consumption and more restrained aesthetics, while conversely, during a phase of economic expansion, consumers welcome splashy extravagance. Not surprisingly, in China \u2014 a country where the economy is booming and young consumers consider themselves brands \u2014 the customization trend is in high demand. China\u2019s millennial and Gen-Z luxury consumers interpret personalization as a resource that helps them fulfill their right to self-expression and unabashed individualism.", "Longchamp was one brand that was at the forefront of this current customization trend. Way back in 2004, the French luxury leather goods company launched the first customized Le Pliage\u00ae Personalized handbag. It was extremely popular, and as Sophie Delafontaine told Jing Daily, Longchamp \u201ckept on renewing it ever since \u2014 particularly when we decided to add Le Pliage\u00ae Cuir a decade later.\u201d She points out that through personalization, customers have \u201cthe opportunity to create their very own it-bag.\u201d", "But today\u2019s focus on customization can even be seen in smaller labels. Robert Wun is a Hong-Kong born fashion designer best known for his signature edgy style and sculptured silhouettes. Recently, he told Jing Daily, \u201cThe Robert Wun brand is always about uniqueness,\u201d and the designer has forged a customer-centric model where he discusses ideas with specific clients in order to construct a bespoke luxury product for them.", "Wun says that \u201cthere is a particular joy and satisfaction in made-to-order designs with specific clients,\u201d because, throughout the process, the designer understands the needs of the customer, while the buyer sees the effort going into a bespoke design. This process of creating alongside the designer strengthens the bond between them both, but it\u2019s impossible for many luxury brands to offer a truly bespoke experience. Fortunately, a connection with the audience can be constructed through monogramming or new personalization processes.", "Louis Vuitton\u2019s Hot Stamping program, for instance, lets buyers hot stamp their monograms on small leather products. This process is available in select Louis Vuitton flagship stores, comes complimentary, and is quick (requiring just a few minutes of the buyer\u2019s time).

For those paying closer attention to Chinese markets, they will know that over the past three years, the Tencent-backed shopping app for discounted goods has seen incredible growth, but it also had a checkered history with counterfeit listings.", "When Pinduoduo debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2018, it was touted as China\u2019s fastest-growing business. But by August, it faced an investigation from the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) over its failure to challenge intellectual property infringements, and the company\u2019s stock had fallen. Pinduoduo had to act quickly. It claimed to have removed 1,128 stores and taken down 4.3 million listings from its site. But this one week of action was a band-aid for a much bigger problem, and in April 2019, the company was blacklisted for the first time as part of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report into \u201cnotorious markets.\u201d While Alibaba\u2019s Taobao website was also condemned for the third year running in the same USTR paper, the report did at least acknowledge that their group \u201chas taken some steps to curb the offer and sale of infringing products.\u201d", "The threat to brands\u2019 profits and reputations because of social shopping apps such as Pinduoduo, Little Red Book, WeChat\u2019s Weidian, and Taobao\u2019s Xianyu is real, but it\u2019s also just one part of a complex and evolving situation for luxury brands. Pinduoduo is well known as a platform for cheap goods and group discounts, and its growth has been fuelled by the mobile engagement and gamification technologies that are aimed at its reported 77.5 million daily users from the poorer regions of provincial China. Therefore, while it might seem as if the company, known as \u201cChina\u2019s Groupon,\u201d poses a lesser threat for high-end fashion and lifestyle brands, there are actually several reasons why it deserves closer scrutiny.", "China cares about social commerce", "Regardless of its current consumer demographics, China\u2019s embrace of social shopping is growing. Apps like Pinduoduo encourage users to create profiles and then generate their own content in order to influence their networks into group buying and sharing for discounts. Its market has been projected to be worth roughly $150 billion by 2020, meaning that it will possess a noticeable part of the overall e-commerce environment. China appears to care deeply about social shopping, so luxury brands who hope to continue capitalizing on the 33 percent of the revenue that Chinese consumers contribute to the $1.2 trillion trade in luxury products simply must pay attention.", "One of the appeals of social shopping is that it offers the safety and mutual reinforcement of a communal experience. Users can create networks and then share and promote Pinduoduo-listed products through WeChat, resulting in group discounts, competitions, and other incentivized purchases. This disruptive \u201cteam purchasing\u201d idea has resonated particularly well in a culture where online commerce had previously been centralized by the Alibaba/JD duopoly. Shaun Rein, the author of \u201cThe War for China\u2019s Wallet: Profiting from the New World Order,\u201d states, \u201cThe potential of social commerce is huge because people like to buy what their friends recommend. Increasingly, in China\u2019s e-commerce landscape, people don\u2019t know what sales channel to trust, but if they see their friends purchasing things on social commerce sites, they are more likely to buy.\u201d For cautious Chinese consumers approaching expensive branded purchases for the first time, this kind of peer endorsement is vital. Therefore, the social commerce model seems like a natural fit with luxury goods \u2014 but also a possible future home for fake listings.", "The days of trading down may be limited", "Pinduoduo is acknowledged as a place for lower-income shoppers to buy everyday goods rather than high-end brands, but that doesn\u2019t mean the market might not have the capacity to support luxury items. Although many social commerce shoppers currently have the desire to purchase luxury goods, their limited financial circumstances mean that cheap \u201cshanzhai\u201d mass copies are more common purchases.", "However, younger and wealthier Chinese shoppers in the current climate expect unique luxury items and are increasingly willing to pay for them. As these Millennial and Gen-Z consumers represent an influential segment on social media, the energy that they devote to promoting themselves and their purchases will likely drive purchase mimicry throughout the country. With continued economic growth and increased purchasing power \u2014 even in the provincial cities \u2014 the desire for genuine luxury products will become more prevalent, but so too will the appearance of counterfeits that are closer to the real thing; so-called \u201csuper fakes.\u201d", "As brands become more common and less exclusive in rural locations, the drive for more expensive products and higher-end brands may also increase. This process already started in August 2018 when Pinduoduo committed to an escalation of branded goods through a \u201cPavilion\u201d that would push global brands out to the provinces (a big part of the platform\u2019s buyer base). And further subsidies for farmers, poverty alleviation initiatives, and e-commerce training sessions suggest that the social commerce market will likely reach new heights in the future.", "The West has been here before", "When the first wave of e-commerce appeared in the \u201890s, it was a revolutionary new way for all brands to bring goods directly to customers. This was particularly important for the luxury sector because sales could suddenly be increased in untapped Asian markets. Distance and cost had made establishing brick-and-mortar retail units prohibitively expensive, but e-commerce presented a real solution. Many marketplaces were initially unregulated, though, and this led to waves of listings for counterfeit products, which destabilized profits. When brand protection initiatives like eBay\u2019s VeRO program began later in the decade, it set in motion the marketplace-centric brand protection strategies that still exist to this day.", "But if anything serves as a template for how social media will pose a future threat to brands in China, it\u2019s what\u2019s currently happening across the U.S. and Europe. Sellers of luxury brands such as Michael Kors, Rolex, and Gucci have migrated in droves to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, leading to record seizures and regular headlines. Sellers establish interpersonal relationships within private groups and then communicate via encrypted Whatsapp messages with buyers. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s also found its feet with Chinese counterfeiters who use channels like WeChat, Instagram, YuPoo and TikTok as additional arms to reach both Chinese and international customers.", "Managing disruption", "Pinduoduo and other social commerce disruptors have shown that the conventional marketplace model of buying and selling counterfeit goods is changing. For luxury brands who want to capitalize on the Chinese appetite for expensive products while limiting the number of fake products sold online, developing social shopping awareness is crucial. Marketplaces and website domains enforcing against counterfeit listings remain vital, but the mobile, fluid, and engaging nature of these new platforms may give some indication as to why luxury brands need to also consider counterfeiting solutions that are culturally relevant and forward-thinking.", "\u00a0", "Fiona Gao is Head of Business Development at Pointer Brand Protection."]}, {"title": "Fendi Opens a New Chapter of Its History in Shanghai", "meta": "July 2, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Fendi\u2019s love for China was recently celebrated with a catwalk show titled Roma in Shanghai, which also featured a moving tribute to its creative director of 54 years, Karl Lagerfeld.", "This is only the second major Fendi event to take place in China over the past 12 years and represents a major step forward for the brand.

Luxury is an emotional purchase, so why not allow a consumer to choose when or where they want to buy it? The fact that most car brands do not offer the option of buying online doesn\u2019t mean consumers would never do it. The consumer needs to be the focus of all brand thinking.

On top of that, correcting a blurry brand will take additional investment and time on top of the time and money the brand has already spent.", "All channels are equally important", "Brands need to be wherever the consumer is, and whatever channels consumers choose, brands need to be able to tell their brand stories consistently and precisely across all channels. It\u2019s the same logic as controlling the sales environment in brick-and-mortar. Setting the highest standards needs to apply online, too.

An automated A.I. tool should scan every online conversation for trending topics and anomalies to identify critical issues in real time. Anything less than that is not acceptable in today\u2019s world of digital natives. Any brand that operates without these powerful data analytic tools in China, which has the most digital luxury market in the world, risks committing brand suicide if something unexpected happens.

Since 2006, the British company has reinvented itself as an \u201cend to end\u201d digital enterprise by using consumer behavior analytics to better understand the purchasing habits of shoppers and to run targeted marketing campaigns. According to Socialwall, Burberry assigns over 60% of its advertising budget to social media platforms. This transformed the company into a digital colonizer leading the way in avant-garde digital experiences.

Meanwhile, the brand\u2019s Art of the Trench campaign has reinvented Burberry, turning it into a luxury brand that belongs to a wider and more globalized community. By making the brand more accessible, Burberry has added innovation to the DNA of a traditional business model \u2014 and that has also helped them enhance their customer experience.

Any cyber attack can put the corporate reputation at serious risk and threaten the brand\u2019s market value; thus cyber security is as important to a business as strategy or branding.

In 2011, they acquired the Belgium leather goods brand Delvaux, followed by Clergerie (a high-end French footwear company), and finally, Sonia Rykiel, which has been its biggest investment thus far.", "Sonia Rykiel: the disaster scenario  In 2012, the Rykiel family was looking for tangible help opening more stores around the world, which would require a lot of cash. The accessories line, especially the shoes, was doing quite well wholesale, and they were also looking for a refreshing new designer to translate the Sonia Rykiel DNA into new products.", "When meeting with Fung executives, the daughter of Sonia, Nathalie Rykiel, thought she met the right partner to push the brand internationally. She stated publicly that LVMH or Gucci Group (previously, Kering) aren\u2019t the only options out there. But her dreams vanished quickly. First Heritage Brands quickly adopted an ultra-conservative and cautious approach. Instead of expanding the brand\u2019s footprint, they focused on reorganizing and on how they could save money to improve the company\u2019s ROI. It was not a plan to open stores at all.", "Then they hired a new designer to manage the Paris studio: French designer Julie de Libran. Coming from Louis Vuitton, Libran was certainly a talented and experienced designer, but maybe not the right fit for the Sonia Rykiel DNA. A younger and more rebellious designer with a more aggressive approach to brand expression would have been a much better fit; someone with a disruptive approach to design would\u2019ve helped the brand to relaunch in new, social media-dominated markets. The brand\u2019s message could\u2019ve easily appealed to many on the internet if it had been adapted correctly. Sonia Rykiel was a famous feminist who placed a strong emphasis on empowering women. In the early 2000s, Sonia Rykiel stores were even selling sex toys along with their knitting collections and accessories. It was a way to express sexual freedom, something that could\u2019ve resonated well today.", "Year after year, good elements from the company vanished and little was done to attract young, enthusiastic people. The outcome was a disaster: The brand went from total sales of 100 million \u20ac in 2011 to around 20 million in 2018.

But this seems to contradict the continued high growth rates of the most successful luxury brands in China like Dior, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, or Gucci. How can we talk about them failing to address China\u2019s biggest market?", "Yes, many brands are doing well, but most successful brands aren\u2019t tapping into their full potential, and many others are failing miserably. While the majority of brands entering China have a steep learning curve, nearly every brand is not maximizing their potential in the market today. Here are five reasons why brands are leaving good money on the table when it comes to millennials:", "1. Underestimating Chinese consumers", "Chinese millennial consumers are highly educated, and their familiarity with digital tools makes them highly empowered. Despite that, brands do little \u2014 or the wrong type of \u2014 market research. Traditional market research is a waste of money in China because surveys focus on too few cities, don\u2019t reach enough consumers, and their results are too slow. In the fast-changing world of Chinese millennial consumers, studies that were taken even two months ago might already be useless or misleading. Only real-time consumer measurements of AI-powered social media listening techniques can steer brands accurately in China. Chinese social media networks are firewalled and challenging to analyze, but with the right expertise and machine learning, brands can correctly observe or analyze data on their consumers, brand, competition, and more.", "2. Using the wrong communication content", "Many brands fail because they convince themselves that the content produced for the rest of the world will also be relevant in China. Aside from the content itself, brands must know the delivery systems. Many underestimate the importance of Chinese key opinion leaders (KOL) and influencers, given that they help brands successfully engage with potential customers on local social media platforms like WeChat. Meanwhile, companies waste millions of dollars with \u201cclassic\u201d advertising in China instead of fully embracing digital methods that produce a measurable ROI. Creating the wrong type of content not only wastes money on bad methods, but brands can\u2019t even measure whether or not that marketing has lead to any significant sales.", "3. Underestimating the power of brands in China", "Chinese consumers love brands because they identify with them. That\u2019s why brand storytelling is much more important in China than in any other place in the world. Yet despite this, most brands do not create an end-to-end brand experience for Chinese consumers. With few exceptions, they focus on selling and not on creating an experience across all touch points. That requires a thorough brand audit, a positioning exercise, and a customer journey assessment. Without perfect brand storytelling at each interaction point, luxury brands will lose the Chinese consumer, without exception. It\u2019s surprising that luxury brands aren\u2019t rigorous about experience creation. Chinese millennials are more discerning in China than in other countries, yet they are not serviced better.", "4. Not being digital enough", "Some brands have a CRM (customer relationship management) system, but it\u2019s handled by customer service, while others have a CRM online, but one that isn\u2019t at all related to store visits. In other words, many brands do not use their most valuable asset: data about their consumers. And by not using their data, they are not servicing their consumers sufficiently. Therefore, by not being digital enough, they create inferior consumer experiences. This is positively the kiss of death in China. Everything MUST be digital there. In all cases, a digital infrastructure must be designed and deployed that connects all data \u2014 including sales data \u2014 and uses advanced data querying methods to create highly personalized experiences that feel luxurious. Only digital means can do that today.", "5. There is no free lunch", "Launching in China without a budget and just hoping you\u2019ll attract hundreds of millions of millennials in China is a guarantee for failure. Weak brands in China with bad economics, unprofitable store locations, and expensive overhead costs will infinitely weaken a brand, and in such scenarios, the brand\u2019s best talent will quit, further accelerating its downfall. Investing in the perfect launch, after thorough brand and strategy development, is absolutely necessary. For many luxury companies, China has become their biggest headache and correcting mistakes winds up being much more expensive than if they\u2019d done it right from the beginning.", "In short, brands need to rethink their approach when it comes to understanding China and its millennial consumers. They need to become consumer-centric, meaning that they must create relevant content and build a strong brand identity. That requires a strong story and a rigorous customer journey design. They also need to become digital: If they think they are already digital, then they need to become even more digital. And they definitely can\u2019t launch in China without investing first.

To be more precise, it\u2019s the most important market for luxury brands to find, select, and connect with the right KOL. This is still quite a challenge for many Western companies that are trying to market to Chinese consumers. But why do Chinese consumers rely so much on influencers in the first place? The answer can be broken down into three main reasons.", "First, China is the youngest and most digital-oriented luxury market. Consumers get most of their information about brands from Chinese social platforms like WeChat, and the nature of those platforms makes it more likely that consumers in China will connect with influencer content than in other countries in which websites and reviews play more prominent roles. Plus, firewalled platforms like WeChat make it difficult for brands to connect directly with consumers on social media \u2014 so KOL-driven content gives them much more visibility.", "Second, Chinese consumers go to social media ahead of any other type of platform to make their luxury purchase decisions. They\u2019ve grown comfortable with receiving guidance from influencers they follow, even if they know that all of the most relevant KOLs have highly paid contracts with large international brands like Christian Dior, Est\u00e9e Lauder, or Gucci, to name a few. It\u2019s all about emulating the lifestyle of their idols, following their advice, and becoming part of their communities.", "Third, many Chinese consumers are still relatively new to the luxury market. They\u2019re looking for guidance and typically trust KOLs more than the information they receive directly from brands.", "To recap, influencers give consumers direction, inspiration, and curation. They help them to navigate through the quickly changing luxury market \u2014 to know which items are \u201chot,\u201d which sneakers are coolest, or which bag or jacket is best. A KOL\u2019s influence goes far beyond the celebrity endorsements that western brands like Rolex or Aston Martin have used over the decades in Western markets. By following a KOL, consumers receive all types of appropriate advice, such as how to dress in a specific situation or which hotel is best to stay in on a specific vacation. While Western celebrity endorsements seem to simply connect their image to a brand, KOLs bring brands into particular and personal contexts. That is their greatest power in influencing Chinese consumers.", "How then, you may ask, should luxury brands select the right influencer? The most important aspect is how a brand\u2019s equity and market positioning fits with the influencer\u2019s image. This sounds logical, but I\u2019m surprised at how few brands have systems in place to help them make these selections in a precise, risk-averse way. The first step is understanding how Chinese consumers see the brand, which in turn requires brand audits combined with advanced consumer listening capabilities that dig deeper than the relatively closed-off Chinese social media networks. Similarly, this exercise should be done with a group of potential influencers to learn who is following them, how they are seen, and which conversations they\u2019re connected to. In the end, the brand has to match the influencer.", "Once a match is found, the right content strategy needs to be developed. Then the brand should use AI-based data analytics to measure exactly how the influencer campaign is resonating with consumers by tracking actual sales back to the influencer. An integrated data ecosystem ultimately lets the brand evaluate if it has chosen the right influencer or created the right communication content.", "Given the importance of KOLs in China, it\u2019s surprising that companies rely more on gut feeling when selecting influencers and content rather than data-driven decision-making. KOLs aren\u2019t just \u201cnice to have\u201d in China \u2014 they\u2019re one of the most important marketing tools in the country today, and as such, they need to be managed much more precisely than most brands realize.", "\u00a0", "Daniel Langer\u00a0is CEO of the luxury, lifestyle and consumer brand strategy firm\u00c9quit\u00e9.

The majority of luxury fashion designers tend to take to legal routes to protect their intellectual property rights, while some of them, such as Gucci\u2019s Creative Designer Alessandro Michele, embraced the issue with a playful attitude, seeing copycat as a way of re-creating and even being creative. But the reality of the issue is more complex. Big-name brands often see themselves as the victim, but sometimes, it can be the other way around. For example, a Chinese fashion student studying at the Parsons School of Design accused the high fashion brand Viktor & Rolf of copying his designs for its 2017 Autumn/Winter Haute Couture collection in Paris.", "On the legal side, copyright and design protection in fashion is an area where different countries and jurisdictions have varying legal standards, adding a layer of uncertainty to the future of Louis Vuitton case. \u201c[The chance to win] will depend on any design rights or copyrights Louis Vuitton has registered [before the launch of Belle\u2019s disputed sneakers], or unregistered, especially in China, where Belle\u2019s main customers and market are located,\u201d says Ding-Voorhees. \u201cAnother factor to Louis Vuitton\u2019s success in this dispute would be its fame in China over its particular design of the Archlight shoes.\u201d", "The fact that Belle International Holdings is an established fashion player in the Chinese market also makes the case trickier. Founded by Tang Yiu in 1991, Belle International Holdings is China\u2019s leading women\u2019s footwear retailer, accounting for over 20 percent of the Chinese shoe market share. The company went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015. \u201cEven if Louis Vuitton is able to claim protection of its design rights or copyrights in the Archlight shoes, either through direct registration or Berne Convention, the court would also listen to the other side of the story from Belle, for example, their rights, if any, their creation process, and the timeline of their launch, etc,\u201d adds Ding-Voorhees.", "The journey to protect copyright and design patent rights in China has mostly been tough, if not impossible, for international luxury brands. A previous success was the Italian skiwear brand Moncler, which, in 2013, won a case against a Beijing-based clothing company that produced similar winter parkas and copied its trademark. Moncler was compensated $430,000 for the losses.", "Therefore, for brands doing business in China, being preventive rather than responsive to design infringements is more effective in avoiding similar problems coming back to them in the future.

However, the experience of South Korea and Japan, who previously went into political controversies with China, should be a concern for consumer-facing brands in the U.S. For example, in 2017, a geopolitical dispute between South Korea and China over the THAAD missile launch led Chinese consumers to voluntarily boycott Korean products, which seriously swept across the Korean business community from car-making, beauty, fashion to tourism.", "In an anonymous interview with Jing Daily, a marketing professional working at a high-end American fashion brand admitted that the company has serious concerns about how the business will be adversely affected by a decreasing customer interest from China as a result of the current disputes.", "Currency fluctuations and growth concern", "European luxury fashion companies, though not in the center of the confrontation, should be concerned as well.

Last year, the British luxury brand Burberry allegedly burned more than $37.6 million of its own unsold merchandise to prevent it from being sold at bargain basement prices. This practice, apparently common in the fashion industry, has spurred criticism from not only shareholders, but also from consumers worried about the environmental impact of this practice and others in the fashion industry. Now, the topic of sustainability is reaching a new height, with many luxury brands, such as Stella McCartney, Gucci, and Herm\u00e8s\u00a0issuing \u201csustainability\u201d statements, announcing their stand for this approach loud and clear.", "But what exactly is sustainable fashion? As much as it has become a buzz word throughout the industry today, there seems to be a gap between what consumers think it is what business actually need to do to make it happen. According to a report commissioned by the financial services corporation ING, entitled, \u2018From Sustainability to Business Value Finance,\u2019 the top three reasons for implementing sustainability targets in business today are driven by the desire to grow revenue (39%), reduce costs (35%), and/or protect their brand (30%). While consumers choose to buy sustainable goods primarily for \u201csafety and health\u201d reason, according to a report released by the China Chain Store & Franchise Association (CCFA), in August last year, \u201cenvironmental protection\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d reasons closely followed. But still, consumers hold on to the stereotypes against sustainable fashion (for better or worse), including the use of recyclable material, fair trade, and banning child labor. So buying sustainable products for some fits their altruistic needs \u2014 at face value, it\u2019s a trophy choice.", "So is the problem to greener fashion a matter of educating consumers \u2014 of letting them know true sustainability comes with a price? Well, it depends. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t get to see the manufacture enough, that\u2019s not just in China, but at the global scale,\u201d claims Janice Wang, CEO of apparel business & product development consulting firm Alvanon. That\u2019s why consumers are skeptical about paying a higher price for sustainable labels, \u201ceven if they see it, whether the claim is real or not is still up to debate.\u201d", "For some brands, it depends on how much, or what kind of information they are willing to share with their customers. The luxury conglomerate Kering\u2019s push for transparency in China resulted in them creating a Mini Program, \u201cMy EP&L,\u201d which allows users to calculate the environmental \u201cprofit and loss\u201d of their purchases in general (or a \u2018moral score,\u2019 if you may). Ideally, consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions based on a score that is broken down by the materials, the sourcing of materials, and the manufacturing region of a product. However, whether consumers are actively using the program to make ethical choices is yet to be examined. And would they really purchase something based on how high of an environmental-friendly score they can get? The answer is unknown.", "Some, especially the younger generations, even question whether or not they should contribute to environmental problems by constantly buying new clothes. Many now opt to shop at second-hand stores or at rental fashion shops and apps. This may be bad news for the industry whose under pressure to sell, but deep down, both business and consumers\u2019 intentions seem to be increasingly aligned \u2014 that is to maximize the value of fashion products we wear and are produced.", "It\u2019s a balancing act of supply and demand, argued Wang, who is the third generation of a family rooted in the apparel industry, in Hong Kong. \u201cThe problem never comes from the manufacturer side, they are extremely waste-conscious,\u201d she says. Instead, the problem happens in the planning side \u2014 on how to best design and sell to the market. Wang\u2019s company believes sizing is an important step to make this process more efficient, by creating an understanding of pattern making and garment production to help brands, designers, and retailers ensure their products achieve the best possible fit. (The company has recently published a report advocating that profit can coexist well with a social and environmental impact.)", "Educating consumers doesn\u2019t happen overnight, to be sure, but adjusting supply and demand to plan for little or no unsold goods can also be managed. Luxury brands may have the privileges and resources to grant consumers the \u201ctrophy,\u201d by charging a premium price for sustainable goods, which leaves a great deal of margin to exploit. But for fast fashion, or even accessible luxury, this might be harder to accomplish. Nevertheless, sustainability requires both businesses and consumers to call for a conscious choice before they produce or purchase, sometimes less could mean more."]}, {"title": "The Paradox of Sustainable Luxury \u2014 and 3 Ways to Solve It", "meta": "April 29, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Many of China\u2019s young luxury consumers seek experiences over products, which is why so many are choosing exotic vacations.

Questions about where materials come from, the quality of colors and dyes used, and how workers are treated during the production process are just a few of the issues brands now need to answer. And the answer should better be that the entire process of sourcing and production has been holistically aligned and meticulously controlled. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Herm\u00e8s faced massive social media scrutiny for alleged mistreatment of crocodiles that were the source of the leather in some of their most famous bags. Meanwhile, Gucci announced about 18 months ago that they\u2019d no longer use fur in any of their products. Times are changing.", "Still, many companies believe that they can get away with sourcing materials or production methods that don\u2019t meet today\u2019s highest ethical standards. What may have worked in the past will soon not be acceptable. In a study we did for the Chinese market using AI-based advanced data querying, we noticed that among trending terms in conversations about luxury fashion, the combination of luxury and sustainability was near the top. It was not yet the No. 1 purchase driver, but it was trending upwards.", "Why is sustainable luxury such a difficult topic to implement? First, luxury has to offer a unique experience, which in most cases is done by outperforming other brands in the segment, in at least one area. For example, a luxury handbag may be available in a rare leather that requires specialized training to handmake the bag. I call these extreme performance points, and when things get extreme, it\u2019s often difficult to produce or consume them in a truly sustainable fashion.", "When we look at this from a different perspective, the dilemma becomes more pronounced. If we want to create a product that\u2019s sustainable \u2014\u00a0in all aspects \u2014 there is a good chance that the performance may suffer and that the product will no longer be identified as a real luxury. And a brand that is not perceived as luxury does not provide consumers with what we call \u201cAdded Luxury Value,\u201d such as social status, enhanced attractiveness, ultimate experiences, and an unforgettable treat. When these effects are missing, the willingness to pay such high prices decreases and people walk away. How can this be solved?", "1. Luxury brands and products need to be luxury first", "This sounds silly, but in my experience, it\u2019s the point where most mistakes are made. When the sum of its parts is not perceived as luxury, people won\u2019t pay the enormous premium. Brands fail, products won\u2019t be sold. The luxury experience has to be at the center of all activities. BMW had to learn this lesson the hard way, when their electric models flopped. Despite several hundred million dollars in investment in highly-sustainable production facilities and sustainable materials in the cars, the \u201cfeel\u201d of both the i8 sports car and the i3 urban car was not seen as a luxury or even premium by many. The i3 could not compete in terms of range with vehicles that were sold at much lower price points, while the i8 was not competitive in acceleration versus a Tesla Model S. Hence, with reduced performance and experience, the cars remained exotic but could hardly be seen anywhere.", "2. Create a sustainable business model", "Once the extreme performance points of luxury are defined, brands need to come up with a holistic end-to-end strategy of how to produce that performance with the least impact on the environment. This is an excellent opportunity to innovate and differentiate. I encourage my clients to think out-of-the-box and see sustainability as the enabler. In times of super-empowered, well-informed consumers, greenwashing is not an option for any company. It is crucial to think of the business model in totality and find ways to improve continually.", "3. Be bold \u2014 challenge and talk about actions", "Many companies are silent when it comes to sustainability. Sustainability efforts are communicated to investors and shareholders, and in an abstract way to consumers, but few companies understand the power of actively talking about sustainability. Stella McCartney, for example, is one of the few who has advocated for sustainable fashion and who has challenged her competition to follow her lead. Consumers look for brands that take a stance and take actions \u2014\u00a0so be bold!", "So many seasoned managers are still skeptical about sustainable luxury. While they publicly embrace the idea, on a corporate level, they don\u2019t believe that sustainability sells when you talk to them off the record. But with millennial and Generation Z consumers becoming such a strong shopping segment, this reluctant approach is dangerous, as it does not match their expectations.

Despite the current economic uncertainty, McKinsey is confident about the pivotal role that China will continue to play in the global luxury market going forward. The country\u2019s rising upper-middle-class households, according to the report, is the backbone of the growth, stating that 350 million people in China will earn between $2,600 and $3,900 per month per household by 2025.", "", "With a slew of luxury brands from LVMH to Kering to Herm\u00e8s delivering their latest earnings results in recent weeks, there\u2019s a growing concern that luxury in China has become a winner-takes-all market. \u201cYou see strong brands getting stronger, and not-so-strong brands getting weaker,\u201d said Daniel Zipser, Senior Partner of McKinsey, as well as one of the major authors of the report. \u201c[But] I do think there is an opportunity for brands that are not as big and as strong in the China market to turn around and to accelerate their growth. The reason is that Chinese luxury consumers today are very diverse.\u201d", "Zipser highlighted the younger generations \u2014 Millennials and Gen-Z \u2014 the segment that he considered looking for diversity in their choice of brands and having a strong desire for experimentation. \u201cTo young generations, brands are important but not as important as to the older generations,\u201d he said. \u201cJust come with right strategies and engage this segment in digital means, there is an opportunity for brands that are not that strong today to actually change pace and track, and to become a success tomorrow.\u201d", "Below, Jing Daily summarized four major takeaways from the report:", "", "Chinese shoppers are both well-informed and new", "To a certain extent, the McKinsey report challenges the current \u201csophistication\u201d discourse about Chinese luxury shoppers, pointing out that a large segment of luxury consumers are new to this type of consumerism.\u00a0Its survey indicates 50 percent of Chinese post-90s generation and over 30 percent of the post-80s respondents only made their first luxury purchase last year. For the older generations like the post-65s and the post-70s group, it\u2019s true as well. Less than 50 percent of them bought their first designer piece less than three years ago, the report said.", "\u201cIt is not contradictory,\u201d said Zipser. \u201cYou do have consumers who are actually sophisticated \u2014 who have been to luxury stores and gained information through social media. The interesting part is it is the first time Chinese consumers reaching the affordability to actually making the purchases of luxury.\u201d", "The takeaway for brands, therefore, is \u201cdon\u2019t try to fool Chinese consumers,\u201d Zipser added. It is equally important for brands to understand how this finding is going to shape and affect their overarching strategies from product design, retail, to marketing and branding.", "Chinese consumers are trend-driven", "Chinese consumers\u2019 heavy reliance on digital media to receive information on luxury and fashion makes their shopping decisions trend-driven. \u201cThese new luxury consumers are influenced more by what is happening right now, leaving ample room for brands with the right strategy to shape their tastes,\u201d the report stated.", "", "This explains why \u201cIT\u201d bags, shoes, and clothes abound in the Chinese market. A great number of customers, who are not as sophisticated and discerning as the Western counterparts, are hugely influenced by what celebrities, fashion key opinion leaders (KOLs), and brands say and recommend via social media. An example used by McKinsey to illustrate this point is how Chanel promoted its Gabrielle bag in China. The brand first hired Yang Mi, one of China\u2019s top actresses (and who represented brands including Estee Lauder, Michael Kors, and Stuart Weitzman), to pose for the campaign, which stirred widespread public interest and then collaborated with KOLs like Mr. Bags to push the campaign message to its targeted audience.", "Luxury shopping activities bring social capital", "The underlying social nature of luxury shopping is particularly important to Chinese shoppers, the report said. Young Chinese consumers view ownership and affiliation with designer brands as a form of social capital; not just something to wear \u2014 but a lifestyle choice that marks them as part of a distinct and exclusive community. McKinsey also noted nearly 70 percent of post-90s consumers, who they surveyed, said purchasing luxury goods was a way to make them feel distinct from others.", "The overwhelmingly social nature of luxury consumption in China also made consumers become more aware and appreciative for craftsmanship, the report said. Younger consumers, in particular, tend to value design, fabric, and the production process.", "Sales associates = personal stylists to young Chinese shoppers", "McKinsey further notes Chinese shoppers\u2019 expectation on brands\u2019 sales associates edge higher and higher, as they look for personalization and customization from their interaction with luxury brands.

This younger generation expects a personalized service approach, from helping pick out accessories based on an intimate knowledge of the customer\u2019s personality or their previous purchases or preferences to being able to help them get into\u00a0fashion shows or parties \u2014 more as a friend than merely a salesperson.", "Additionally, the sales staff is an important pillar in building a seamless, omnichannel shopping experience for consumers, the report says.

Just about ten years ago, most luxury CEOs I talked to told me that there would be no luxury brand selling online ever. Those CEOs either retired or were fired for a good reason. Now, digitization is on top of the luxury industry\u2019s agenda. Hence we see brands that are much more open today, with some players like Gucci, Dior, Chanel, and even Rolls-Royce shifting an enormous focus to digital. Advanced data querying, machine learning, and AI require much more competency than many in-house teams have. Few companies in the world truly master AI, and very few can combine AI with luxury strategies as \u00c9quit\u00e9 does.", "How can AI improve the customer experience?", "First of all, let me clarify that when most people speak about AI, they mean something different. The word is very often overused. \u201cAdvanced data querying\u201d would be more precise in many cases. AI is just a component of it and makes sense in specific cases where complex connections between data points need to be identified. Advanced data analytics can help to document and improve the consumer experience by generating insights and making sure that each customer always receives personalized service. As an example: Imagine that you regularly shop at your local Louis Vuitton store, let\u2019s say in Shanghai. They know you, and the service experience is tailored to you. Then you travel to Hong Kong on a business trip. Ideally, the store staff should know all about your history and preferences, and you should feel at home. What you don\u2019t want is to feel like a stranger just because you are not at your home store or because you access the brand online. All touchpoint experiences need to be connected and seamless. But that\u2019s not yet AI, that would be a holistic CRM [customer relationship management] system.", "On top of that CRM infrastructure, AI can now help you identify complex patterns, predict what you may like, and trigger personalized customer journeys, perhaps through an automated email with specific content based on predictive analytics. Hence, the AI system ideally triggers an interaction precisely at the right moment. The ideal result is a personalized experience that excites consumers across all touch-points with relevant content.", "What are some mistakes luxury brands usually make with AI?", "The biggest mistake is to underestimate how game-changing this technology is. I believe that in the future, brands will either succeed by powering their customer journeys with AI-generated insights and actions or they won\u2019t survive. That\u2019s because competing without it means not generating enough insight, wasting digital advertising money, and using content that isn\u2019t optimized. This is simply not sustainable over time. Brands should run on data, not on gut feeling.", "Can you name one luxury brand that you think is good at utilizing AI?", "The auction house Sotheby\u2019s has impressed me with how they use advanced data technologies like AI to determine, for example, which types of paintings might receive the highest bids. Hence, the application goes far beyond the customer journey. A brand should know if a specific advertising campaign triggers a particular sale. AI can provide that if applied in the right way.", "Luxury is emotional while AI is logical. Will AI change the nature of luxury? ", "AI is an enabler. It allows us to identify the roots of issues, make sense of behavior, and reveal otherwise hidden patterns. This, in turn, helps a brand run in a much more efficient way.

For a luxury brand to get Chinese consumers deeply involved \u2014 so much so that they feel they can\u2019t live without its products \u2014 it will need a 3-step process called Culture Marketing. This new approach is based on (1) Understanding, (2) Planning, and (3) Exchanging, and it requires an approach that\u2019s different from the one-way exchanges of the past where brands impose a monolithic vision on their target audiences. This process can be easily applied to any market, but it\u2019s especially helpful in the China market where the demand for customer service is high and opinions spread quickly via Chinese social media.", "\u201cUnderstanding\u201d means brands should use market analysis to gather a deeper knowledge of various customers in today\u2019s fast-changing environment. Successful brands will have their headquarters collaborate with local offices so that their brand identity can be flawlessly communicated through the tools and content that\u2019s best for Chinese customers. This step is crucial, and it relies on the intelligence team being flexible enough to work closely with both specialized consulting firms and their own local branches \u2014 the more knowledge that\u2019s obtained, the higher the chance of successful business growth. Gucci is a good example of a company that aced this step and has had great success in China since it re-launched there.", "Gucci intelligence focused on the China market as a priority, using several Bain & Co. marketing studies and forecasts for inspiration. Their positioning was clear from the beginning and was a clever blend of their new creative director\u2019s vision and the feedback they received from their target market. Their new approach in China was put into place by the new establishment as early as 2015 when they embraced the China market with their #GucciGram social media project, which took advantage of \u201cconsumer familiarity\u201d by featuring a Gucci Tian print with a floral motif that was inspired by 18th-century Chinese landscape painting. They also made smart marketing decisions like sponsoring Art Basel\u2019s Hong Kong fair.", "The second step, or the \u201cplanning\u201d phase, happens when brand executives start to develop a strategic plan that combines brand DNA, product innovations, and the previous step (intelligence reports) to create specific actions for each market. It\u2019s a necessary and tailor-made effort that involves every level of the company. To see this step enacted properly, one only has to look at the Dior\u2019s Chinese New Year WeChat campaign featuring three iconic bags: the Saddle, the Book Tote, and the Lady Dior in Toile de Jouy. Each red-and-white limited-edition bag was made for the China market only, exuding respect for Chinese heritage while simultaneously relying on the French fashion house\u2019s DNA of quality and elegance.", "Brands gathering a deep knowledge of the market tend to create digital activities that are consistent with their own DNA while also finding appreciation from Chinese customers. Dior\u2019s action, the Dior Beauty live stream of their \u201csee now, buy now event\u201d in Chengdu via a WeChat mini-program, was an extremely popular campaign for many reasons. In an hour-long WeChat livestream that took place last November, Dior Beauty creative director Peter Philips ran a series of makeup tips and tutorials involving over 300 influencers and reaching more than 3 million visitors. They were also able to gather interesting data from the event, which had a composition that was 60 percent women, 38 percent millennials, and 20 percent Gen Zers \u2014 all relevant targets.", "Last, but not least, is the \u201cexchanging\u201d stage. This is when feedback from followers and customers is not just respected but integrated into a follow-up strategy. Take the Dior Saddle bag relaunch in China, for instance. Last July, fashion followers criticized the bad quality of a Dior video contribution from blogger Elle Lee that was part of a larger influencer collaboration created on the occasion of the event. But the brand quickly learned their lesson and came back a few months later with a very interesting CNY project that was much more in tune with Chinese customers\u2019 taste and expectations. Today, marketing across cultures demands a two-way exchange. That means a relationship where brands communicate with the customers as well as the other way around. This provides a clear vision on how to interact on a deeper, more emotional level with relevant customers.", "Cultural marketing is the biggest key to success for brands in China today \u2014 it\u2019s more important than the product, the distribution, or state-of-the-art technologies like AI. It focuses on the deep knowledge of the market habits and tastes in a different country. Chinese customers are undoubtedly more demanding, more sensitive, and less keen on passively accepting a top-down institutional approach than other targets in the past, but their hearts can be won on their terms.", "Despite a long presence in Asia, some amazing brands with a great heritage like Tod\u2019s, for example, are still too oriented around their own history/heritage and communicate one-way, so they\u2019re unable to set up flexible marketing strategies that will win over Chinese customers with effective and impactful messages. They simply do rational presentations of their own assets like the brand\u2019s \u201cCiao by Tod\u2019s\u201d advertising campaign is a good example. It\u2019s a campaign that perfectly focuses on how Tod\u2019s is an Italian leather goods brand features leather clothes and accessories, and uses the Italian word \u201cciao.\u201d As a brand showcase, it\u2019s not engaging to Chinese consumers because there is no sign of a two-way conversation, no engagement with the customer\u2019s unique circumstances, and no effort to try and speak the customers\u2019 language.", "The times when a \u201cMade in Italy/France\u201d label necessarily equated with craftsmanship, heritage, lifestyle, and refinement no longer exists. Chinese customers want to be a meaningful part of a brand\u2019s journey, and they don\u2019t appreciate being treated like faceless \u201ctargets.\u201d Their passion and their involvement can contribute to a brand\u2019s evolution, or it can ruin that brand."]}, {"title": "Interview: The New Driver of Luxury Fashion?

Yet over the past four decades, attempts at cutting quality to achieve adequate profit margins in China changed the perception of Chinese imports into one of low-quality, bargain products. This change helped turn the country from a well-established luxury goods producer into a global manufacturer and was a big factor behind the country\u2019s historic economic boom. But now, as China seeks to rebalance its economy with consumption-driven growth, the country has begun embracing a new mantra in order to again promote Chinese luxury products as the embodiment of refinement, authenticity, and originality.", "As the prevailing boom environment favors China creating homegrown luxury brands, Premier Li Keqiang said in a 2016 Government Work Report that the country will start to promote their \u201ccraftsmanship spirit\u201d by stimulating businesses to adopt \u201ccustom-tailored production processes\u201d so they can create high-end products as well as safeguard these traditional crafts.

Therefore, this market will require time to win Chinese consumers\u2019 confidence.

An example of this can be seen during the recent Chinese New Year when various Western designers plastered accessories with Pig motifs (e.g., Louis Vuitton pig key chains, Gucci coin purses, etc.) and rushed out special capsule collections in the hopes of attracting Chinese consumers.

While many of them say that they face extraordinary pressure to shop, others say they need to overdress in order to receive a standard level of hospitality that underdressed Western customers take for granted. \u201cOnce I wore a slightly casual outfit, and I was told by the staff that the shoes I wanted were not for sale,\u201d said Andy Liu, a graduate student in Hamburg, Germany. \u201cAnd the shoes were later sold to another local couple that walked in after me.\u201d Judgmental attitudes from sales assistants aside, perceived notions about Chinese consumer taste also irks Liu. \u201cSales assistants always recommend very basic models to me, as if I have no idea about brands,\u201d he said. He even felt he had to put deliberate thought to which brands he was wearing before entering a luxury store so that he would feel recognized as a legitimate shopper there.", "Erica Giopp shared a similar story about her Chinese clients in Italy\u2019s Cinque Terre region. She once took a group of tourists to a sports retail store to buy a pair of hiking shoes \u2014 with her clients wearing cheap flip-flops \u2014 but soon found that the store assumed Chinese shoppers couldn\u2019t distinguish between cheap and expensive items. Her clients looked around and found some premium-priced sports clothes, but the shop owner told them, while laughing, that \u201cthose are very expensive. There are cheaper options here.\u201d Her clients just laughed and bought out most of the entire shop, leaving the owner shocked.", "As you can see by these differing examples, the experience of shopping while Chinese tends to fall toward one of two extremes: either being overestimated or underestimated. But thanks to social media and the \u201ccall-out\u201d culture it has enabled, Chinese consumers have become hyper-aware of even the subtlest forms of discrimination at retail stores around the world. So how can these types of unfortunate incidents be avoided? Here are three takeaways that can help stores avoid negative treatment of their Chinese customers.", " 1. In luxury, desire, not pressure, makes the sale. All interviewees said that they wanted to be treated with respect, given the freedom to choose, and most importantly, offered genuine human interaction, not fake hospitality. It\u2019s a given that luxury sales staff should be properly trained, and with international customers who could easily become offended by a cultural misunderstanding, staff communication becomes even more crucial.", " 2. Place cultural fluency ahead of language fluency. \u201cChinese-speaking assistants sometimes are good at describing the products with technical language, but they completely lack sensibility about the cultural differences,\u201d Giopp said. Similarly, a Milan-based sales advisor who worked at Gucci, Hermes, and Fendi told Jing Daily that \u201cmany older sale assistants have zero knowledge about Asia in general. They can\u2019t tell the difference between Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people, let alone the nuances of customers across the greater China region, ranging from Taiwan to Hong Kong.\u201d Offering training on general culture to employees at all levels would allow Chinese customers to feel seen, heard, and welcomed.", " 3. Nix any idea of a singular \u201cChinese luxury shopper\u201d you think might exist. In today\u2019s Internet culture, putting the extremely wide variety of Chinese consumers into one box is dangerous. \u201cBrands should be prepared to enter a new era of the multi-client approach instead of working with outdated stereotypes,\u201d said Tiziano Vescovi, a scholar in Chinese tourist shopping behaviors and professor at the Ca\u2019 Foscari University Venice. That means keeping up with the Chinese market, including trends in both shopping and travel.

While only a decade ago it was all about knowing the difference between Gucci and Prada, today\u2019s new generation of wealthy shoppers are driven by the quest for \u201cquality,\u201d \u201cdistinctiveness,\u201d and \u201ccraftsmanship\u201d \u2014 all elements that smaller, bespoke names in the industry often build their brands upon.", "\u201cChinese customers are very dynamic,\u201d said Sara Wong, Director of Merchandising for Hong Kong-based Pedder Group, the accessory specialist part of the Lane Crawford Joyce Group. \u201cThey are traveling and are very connected on social media, so they know what is trending globally.

But they\u2019re also looking for authenticity, originality, and a sense of personality. Niche brands often capture all that.\u201d", "So much so, that a few have become phenomena in China. American skincare company Erno Laszlo is a case in point. The 93-year-old premium brand, which entered the market five years ago on Tmall and with a number of counters across Chinese department stores, has garnered a loyal following for its high-quality products in the country where consumers have even gone so far as to create nicknames for Laszlo\u2019s products as a seal of endorsement. And the company has won this success despite being one of the smaller players in the recent beauty industry boom.", "For Chief Marketing Officer Kristy Watson, that\u2019s exactly what has played to Erno Laszlo\u2019s advantage. \u201cThe smaller you are the easier it is to have a one-to-one conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a niche brand, you have to be better than the larger brands at placing the consumer first. The more consumer-centric the better. The other very important attribute of being niche is the team you build and how their passion translates into a more special experience for the consumer. [And then there is] the power of the consumers themselves. They have become our most important ambassadors. From the day they discover us, they learn and engage until they become part of who we are.\u201d", "To that end, the company makes a point of engaging its clients through word-of-mouth marketing or personal recommendations, while also working closely with KOLs who post on their behalf on Chinese social media platforms. \u201cIt\u2019s a digital-first strategy with offline spaces providing a high touch and human interface,\u201d Watson explained. And it\u2019s working successfully. 60 percent of Erno Laszlo\u2019s business comes from Tmall revenues in China (although Taobao will soon to become its main focus), and the brand is currently in the process of expanding its physical footprint with more \u201cLaszlo Spaces\u201d as a way to create \u201ca richer, more fulfilling connection\u201d for its clientele, Watson said.", "The boutique handbag brand Welden, which only opened in the U.S. in 2015, has also become an \u201cit\u201d name in China thanks to the personal approach it offers consumers, not to mention their clever foray into the country\u2019s digital retail sphere. In November 2017, it debuted on Taobao Global Platform, an online space where Chinese buyers and brand developers showcase handpicked products they love to be livestreamed to over 40,000 followers. In Welden\u2019s case, they were selected by the co-founders of the fashion company And Luxe Inc., Marc Yuan and Zoe Zhang. \u201cThe event was done from my home and the customer was able to establish a connection with us and the products,\u201d said Welden founder Sandy Friesen. \u201cThe feedback was a love for the unique DNA, the quality, and the functionality of the bags.\u201d In the span of two days, the Connecticut-based label had generated almost $300,000 in gross merchandise volume, attracting 808,000 views and 4.06 million likes on its first day alone. By the end of the livestream, it had sold over 1,000 bags.", "Besides the sense of relationship Welden created with its Chinese shoppers, Friesen believes what resonated the most was that the brand had a point of view. \u201cMany of the major brands have started looking similar, and innovation has slowed,\u201d she explained, \u201cwhile smaller labels are offering something novel and exciting to the market. They have a story to share and are captivating customers with that story or journey. Shoppers want more, and niche brands are able to connect on an intimate level with them.\u201d", "For Pedder Group, the demand for boutique luxury labels and emerging designers became so high among clients that they decided to launch \u201cStudio\u201d: a space where the Pedder team brings in a bespoke selection of new brands in both the footwear and handbag sectors. \u201cThis part of our business has seen triple-digit growth season over season in the last couple of years,\u201d Wong said. The retail group also works with some smaller brands to design and develop exclusive capsules collections and pop-ups for their clients. These, too, have performed very well in recent years. \u201cThough newer and younger, some of these designers are just wildly talented,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIn footwear, BY FAR and Aeyde are both performing exceptionally strong. Both brands are relatively new to our brand matrix (under one year) but have already seen significant success. For handbags, Wandler continues to see great growth and demand.\u201d", "As the power of niche continues to gain a foothold, some labels are also exploring creative social media strategies to mark their presence in China. Clergerie, a historical French luxury footwear company that performs remarkably well with Chinese tourists and is currently only available in a few department stores in China, recently unveiled a collaboration with stylist and KOL Lucia Liu for its spring/summer 2019 collection: a line of shoes that blend \u201cFrench shoemaking and Chinese embroidery.\u201d Its announcement created plenty of buzz on both the brand\u2019s and Liu\u2019s social media channels. \u201cBoutique brands are an ever-evolving market,\u201d Wong said.", "As such, those brands might open new frontiers for luxury branding and marketing in China. \u201cSmaller companies can play off their individuality and personal touch in ways more established names can\u2019t. This is where their competitive advantage lies,\u201d said Liang of CDGL. \u201cTheir biggest challenge is to use it wisely in their strategies and efforts.

Indeed, in the last two years, there\u2019s been a boom in luxury that isn\u2019t just made for, but made in, China. Hong Kong-based Lane Crawford has seen major success selling brands like Angel Chen and Comme Moi, whose founder is model Lu Yan. First lady Peng Liyuan has been a champion of several brands, notably Ma Ke, the first Chinese brand to show at Paris Haute Couture. The Bal des D\u00e9butantes in Paris, one of high society\u2019s foremost events, now regularly features young Chinese women alongside moneyed Europeans. And when, heiress Donna Yuan waltzed across the floor, it was a gown by Guo Pei she chose to wear \u2014 the same Chinese designer behind Rihanna\u2019s meme-generating egg-yolk yellow gown at 2015\u2019s Met Gala.", "See, too, how six Chinese brands have penetrated the top 50 of Deloitte\u2019s annual survey into the most powerful global luxury goods firms, all of them jewelers; Chow Tai Fook ranked higher than Herm\u00e8s or Rolex. And, according to a survey by CSG and PR firm Ruder Finn, 74 percent of affluent Chinese are aware of at least one homegrown designer label, with almost half planning to buy local in the next year. Of course, this shift in favor of homegrown luxury is noteworthy for the global market, given that Chinese buyers represent 32 percent of luxury consumption worldwide, per management consultancy Bain & Co.", "So why is domestic luxury jostling for prominence \u2014 and wallet share \u2014 with Rolex, Dior, and company? The crackdown on corruption has certainly impacted imports, illicit or otherwise, making Ma Ke and company more appealing; the recent rumblings of a trade war with the U.S. have underscored those instincts. And China\u2019s demand for luxury, while slower than in recent years, still continues to climb, with one McKinsey report estimating a 121 percent hike in the decade from 2016. There\u2019s one major difference in the maturing Chinese premium market: those new shoppers, who will help it more than double, are from smaller, third-tier cities. Their disposable income, of course, might not stretch as easily to a Louis Vuitton bag, but local luxury counterparts to prestige European brands, though, will be easily within reach.", "The most impactful factor for this shift in spending isn\u2019t political or economic, though. Rather, it\u2019s psychographic, at least according to CSG\u2019s Simon Tye. There\u2019s a marked difference in mindset between the Middle Kingdom\u2019s Generation X and its children, the emerging Generation Z, especially regarding the prestige of Chinese-made premium goods. \u201cThe attitude of 18-24 year olds [towards China] is very different from their parents,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have absolutely no memory of the remnants of Communism, just prosperity and the growth of China.\u201d They don\u2019t see Ma Ke or Guo Pei as a poor substitute for Gucci but rather a worthy rival.", "Indeed, Tye suggests that the rise of homegrown brands is one element in a much larger cultural shift. In the immediate, post-Communist era, new consumers shied away from direct associations with their culture. Compare them with this new generation, which is fiercely proud of anything Chinese. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League proclaimed its first ever Traditional Chinese Garment Day in April 2018, encouraging those same Gen Zers to adopt huafu, or \u201cChinese dress\u201d for the day. It was a marked success. Even in travel, China\u2019s market is looking inwards. Per data from CSG, in 2016, consumers there took an average of 3.9 international trips and 3.1 domestic trips every 12 months.

Looking at the ever-increasing offerings from brands like Off-White, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga, and even Adidas and Nike with their high-tech and high-end lines, we get an idea of how much more disruption we should expect in the luxury shoe business in the future. Fortunately for the industry, shoe creativity seems to have no limits.

The theory is that if consumers are digital first, then brick-and-mortar stores need to be experiential first, otherwise, they have no reason to exist for these consumers.", "Thus, traditional luxury, premium, and lifestyle brands need to reconsider their approaches when it comes to creating consumer experiences.

But the worst part is the accessories store, where cheaply-made brand charms and plastic iPhone cases were on offer for about $10. I left feeling completely confused about what the Mercedes brand even stands for \u2014 was this a self-confident luxury brand, a mediocre caf\u00e9, or a cheap accessory shop? There was no \u201cbrand feel\u201d nor was there anything inspiring or authentic.

That\u2019s a staggering $700 more than an identical brand! There\u2019s neither additional craftsmanship nor anything else that the Louis Vuitton brand adds in terms of value. Because of this, a simple Google search reveals consumer comments decrying the headphones as a \u201cscam.\u201d This isn\u2019t surprising, as the internet\u2019s youngest consumers are also the most discerning. Brand actions like these look desperate while weakening the credibility and equity of the entire brand.

Brands need to first understand how they want to inspire consumers, and then all the following measures and actions must follow those definitions. While it sounds easy to do, I see many brands struggling, especially when it comes to marketing to China\u2019s young and demanding luxury consumers. Their sophistication is often sorely underestimated by traditional brands and managers unfamiliar with the country, which gives a window to authentic new brands that have a genuine Asian mindset and born from within this desirable target group.

It\u2019s important to note that China itself has a massive domestic market, and a lot of designers could happily build a great business there alone.

First, brands need to \u2018speak Chinese\u2019. I don\u2019t speak Chinese, but I can understand their attraction to fashion, quality and creativity. The second point is technology. They are incredibly savvy compared to other countries. Mobile payment is very common in China but not elsewhere.

How has it benefitted your business in China so far?", "This all started with the conversation between me and Richard Liu, the founder of JD.com. We found out that we shared the passion for the evolution of luxury markets in China. He is now on our board of directors. He obviously knows the Chinese market better than anyone. With JD.com\u2019s investment, we agreed to integrate Farfetch technology with JD.com and WeChat data so that we are able to do online marketing in China, building relationships with people who buy on JD.com and use WeChat. That has been implemented since October. We are now able to target our advertisements and online marketing with much better data, using JD.com\u2019s 280 million shoppers and almost one billion users on WeChat.", "To be specific, we have two areas where we\u2019re collaborating with JD.com.

We have offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In total, we have 150 people in China. We have 65 engineers building our app in a completely autonomous way. We just launched our WeChat with every single product on Farfetch. We have our data scientists and our infrastructure in China inside the Great Firewall, which is quite unique, nothing like any other luxury online company with this capability in China. So we have been there for three years and learning a lot about the market.", "How do you deal with competitors like Net-A-Porter, Alibaba\u2019s Luxury Pavilion, and even JD.com\u2019s Toplife?", "We have a very different business model. We are partners to the brands, partners to the boutiques of China. We don\u2019t buy inventory like other players. In terms of the international players, we are the only one with this quite high technological capability in the market. There is really no other Western company in the luxury space with these capabilities. In terms of multi-brand, full-price luxury retail, I think we are quite unique.", "In terms of the local players, I think Farfetch offers a different point of view because we are mostly a cross-border business. So for Chinese consumers, they come to Farfetch for the latest fashion in real-time as soon as it comes out of Paris, Milan and London, Tokyo. This is very different from local players in China, which mostly deal with local inventory and products already in the Chinese market. China is a very large market with multiple players, but what Farfetch offers is quite unique.", "Do you agree with the statement that Chinese consumers are much more willing to purchase luxury goods online than those in the West?", "I agree with the statement. I think what is really interesting is the average age of our China mainland consumers is 29 years old. Incredible! The average age globally is 36. So what we see from China is that we appeal to the Chinese millennials, or Generation Y and Z luxury consumers. This is so exciting. I think they are where the world of online growth will come from in the future. They are also very sophisticated. They buy a lot of different brands, including many smaller designer brands coming from Europe and the United States. We are really excited that Chinese consumers are very sophisticated and mature, and willing to try new designers and new brands.", "What\u2019s the secret to attracting Chinese millennials?", "I think it has something to do with our fashion merchandising. Farfetch has 250,000 products online. That is ten times more than our competitors. We have 1,000 designers on the platform. If you can really offer unique things to China, millennials will be really interested in them because they want to be unique, to reaffirm their individuality, and this is something that Farfetch really empowers them to do.", "I think, then, it is also about the technological experience, making sure that we have a Chinese app. Chinese consumers\u2019 natural behaviors are buying either on WeChat or on an app. It is really important for them to have a fantastic mobile experience with the Chinese app. It is also crucial with WeChat. We have a full catalog on WeChat and other localization features like Alipay, WeChat Pay. All of these things together ensure we serve them in the right way. We also have local customer service, and local personal shoppers and stylists. We even organize events for VIP clients.", "Connecting online to offline has become important for many brands and businesses. What is Farfetch\u2019s strategy on this front?", "We have already connected online to offline in many countries. For example, we offer 90-minute delivery with Gucci in ten cities, including Tokyo, Dubai, Miami, and L.A. We don\u2019t have the domestic logistics yet in China. For the coming fall, we are about to launch domestic delivery within China. We will start with Saint Laurent, being the first label to use our domestic delivery solution. Then brands will be able to offer the same-day delivery, collecting and returning.", "Will you open a physical store in China?", "At the moment, we have no plan to open a physical store in China. Our strategy is to help brands have a presence in China, not only cross-border but also leveraging their presence in China to offer more, such as China delivery, which allows it to be much faster. We also formed a partnership with Chanel to work on future technology. We will be developing in-store technology, which will improve the customer experience and also the shopping experience in the offline world. This partnership with Chanel will start in Europe, but the ideal plan is to roll out globally to all Chanel stores around the world.", "Farfetch has a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast, and you\u2019ve organized events together in China. How does this relationship help you reach out to Chinese consumers?", "Cond\u00e9 Nast is an investor in Farfetch. Jonathan Newhouse is the owner and CEO of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, which includes Cond\u00e9 Nast China, and is also on the board of Farfetch. So we have a three-pronged relationship. We are talking to China at the moment about some exciting initiatives. We will have more and more collaborations between Farfetch and Cond\u00e9 Nast in China this year.", "What are some of the biggest challenges that you foresee for Farfetch in China?", "We are really really excited about China, which is such a fast-growing market. We see opportunities everywhere. Of course, it is a different technology eco-system from Europe. While there is lots of competition in every category, in the luxury category, people have just started to buy these kinds of products. So it is less than 10 percent penetration. I think there is a huge opportunity for us really offer something to consumers.", "If I need to really pick one challenge, it\u2019s the talent, people.

As Pavlovsky mentioned, exclusivity is the definition of luxury, consumers take pride in exclusive items only they can access and exclusive pricing only they are aware of. Going e-commerce could mean many things; it could mean presenting transparent pricing that everyone can gain access to, or buyers missing out on exclusive shopping experiences in store.

Pop-up sales, limited editions, and Valentine\u2019s Day-only are some of the marketing techniques frequently deployed by luxury brands to create exclusivity. While activities on WeChat can be social, transactional, and intimate, it can stimulate an exclusive shopping experience that is closer to a retail environment.

What really appeals to them are things like going into a coffee shop in Brooklyn, or going on an art tour in Berlin, and experiencing cultural elements that are unique to modern culture in those cities.

In hopes of crafting a more engaging shopping experience for Chinese consumers who are less familiar with the social media platforms dominant in the Western world, many luxury brands have turned to the most popular social media platform in China, WeChat,\u00a0by opening their own WeChat official service accounts. This type of account allows brands to promote their campaigns by publishing articles on WeChat, linking to pop-up stores for special sales events, and providing navigation for consumers to physical stores.", "However, with the intensity of competition in the Chinese luxury market, establishing a presence on WeChat is not enough for brands to make a big impression on Chinese consumers.

After all, WeChat is fundamentally a social media application, people expect interaction during use.", "In order to gain first-hand customer experience, we studied sixteen luxury brands on WeChat.* Their official accounts, both service and subscription accounts, were examined, from their profile pages, linked mini-programs, to the content being published.

They also specify a timeline to guarantee the availability of service staff. Compared to hotline numbers or the confusing \u201cservice staff\u201d function, utilizing WeChat\u2019s communicative nature to provide positive customer service is a more effective approach. However, among the sixteen brands investigated, only three of them (Herm\u00e8s, Coach, and Burberry) make it clear that their staff are readily available on WeChat.", "One of the distinctions between WeChat service accounts and subscription accounts is that service accounts will be directly displayed in the \u201cchat\u201d column rather than the \u201csubscription\u201d section inside the column. Therefore, luxury brand WeChat service accounts should use the higher visibility to their advantage and increase the interactivity of accounts to foster engagement and communication with consumers.", "Most luxury brands are well aware of the importance of directing consumers to physical stores through programs inside the service accounts and have come up with various locator function designs with differing levels of effectiveness. Some offer real-time location-based services to direct consumers by mobile maps. Others list their store information in a post. A third method is to send out their store addresses by accessing consumers\u2019 location information, and finally some set up automated answers for certain location-related keywords. For example, a message containing \u201cShanghai\u201d will generate information on all Shanghai stores of the brand.", "Despite the different iterations, the locator function of luxury brands\u2019 WeChat service accounts generally illustrates an incomplete understanding of the Chinese luxury consumer market by ignoring the need of Chinese luxury consumers to shop overseas. While most luxury brands give directions to all their stores in the Greater China area, they tend to not offer information on stores outside China. However, as luxury products are usually priced higher in mainland China than elsewhere, many Chinese consumers prefer buying overseas, either in person or through procurement agencies. Since obstacles like the language barrier and unfamiliarity with different cultures often discourages interested consumers from completing purchases, an official overseas shopping guide from the luxury brands\u2019 WeChat service accounts could be very effective in building Chinese consumers\u2019 trust in brands and encouraging spending.", "Luxury brands regularly post updates of their product lines on their service accounts, and they generally have a stable group of readers. However, it is not a common practice for those luxury brand accounts to reply readers\u2019 comments under their WeChat posts.", "By looking at articles posted by luxury brands on WeChat, it becomes clear that brands seldom respond to any of the comments on their articles. In some cases, they will respond to questions WeChat users have on the brands, but only to those questions concerning new campaigns or sales information in detached tone.", "Having little interaction with readers can actually discourage WeChat users, especially those who comment on content, to pursue and complete purchases and leave them with a poorer impression of the brand. Moreover, it is this distant attitude of most luxury brands\u2019 service accounts that limits the popularity and reach of their posts. Those accounts tend to post articles of succinct phrases and carefully-executed photographs, which keep them emotionless. Given the high-end status of those luxury brands, their choice of that particular style might be a branding strategy; yet this one-way communication between brands and WeChat users is not helpful in spreading brand awareness \u2013 it does not encourage consumers to \u201clike\u201d or share the posts to their WeChat moments, so that the brands\u2019 posts will only have the attention from account subscribers.", "Recently, many brands have attempted to increase their presence in the Chinese market by teaming up with local KOLs, many of whom gain their huge fan bases through social media platforms. While luxury brands rely on those KOLs to promote their products, brands should also improve their WeChat strategies so that consumers will be more motivated to keep up with updates on their latest campaigns. As a matter of fact, many KOLs became popular through the easy-going, trustworthy personalities they established on the internet. As an alternative to featuring KOLs to draw consumers\u2019 attention and create a more engaging experience with consumers, brands can also improve their brand images by being more engaging with consumers online.

In the short-term, it will become overly costly for brands if the new design does not win over consumers. In the longer-term, this strategy will also wear the brand out when the effect of its initial launch fades away. Even though Gucci is still ranked highly among Chinese consumers\u2019 most-wanted luxury brands, some industry experts have expressed their concerns over the longevity of this turnaround.", "Incrementalism represents another approach to innovation and has been adopted widely by luxury powerhouses like Fendi and Prada. This strategy does not eliminate the core values or look of the brand, but embraces change gradually. Needless to say, it is safer than \u201cmake-or-break\u201d innovation, but\u00a0it also requires brands to be able to know where and to what extent they want to apply new elements.

User experience of such features was a challenge in the past (with Google Maps blocked or partially working in China), but we now observe that 73 percent are offering this service through the integration of a local map solution (Baidu Maps, Tencent Maps or Gaode), rather than Google, in order to guarantee an optimal user experience. In addition, 76 percent are offering location-based services, allowing users to directly find a nearby store or directions on how to get there.", "", "The above is a great illustration that brands are now ready to invest in developing the right solutions to support their customer experience, but digging deeper also shows areas where brands can improve. Among the sample of \u00a0brands analyzed, two-thirds are not providing any customer service on WeChat, meaning that in some cases, automated answers would redirect the user to a hotline or the corporate website\u2019s FAQ, and in even worse scenarios, questions were simply left unanswered.", "", "Another relevant illustration is O2O (the acronym for online-to-offline, also referred to as \u201comni-channel\u201d in the West) and how brands are trying to take advantage of WeChat to generate a transaction, or at least stimulate the act of purchase, by driving traffic to both online or offline point of sales.

One explanation could be that many luxury brands still find it hard to work with Alibaba, as their businesses in China have all, to some extent, suffered from the counterfeit phenomenon on that platform.", "When it comes to the level of localization, Coach, Hugo Boss and Ray-Ban are leading, followed by Armani, Burberry, Cartier, Dior and Michael Kors. A high level of localization requires a brand to pay attention to things such as language and currency, and establish\u00a0official presence on major Chinese sites such as Baidu, WeChat, Weibo, and Youku. Meanwhile, local celebrities and fashion bloggers also play a significant role in helping to localize the brands. For example, Burberry has been working closely with Chinese singer and actor Kris Wu, while Cartier uses singer Lu Han to promote their products.", "The availability of \u201cstyle advisory\u201d is also used as a benchmark to measure brands\u2019 digital performance.

Many speakers whose expertise lies in helping\u00a0foreign brands break into China markets shared their insights on this unique demographic. Here are four takeaways from their speeches on how to sell products to Chinese millennials.", "1. Chinese millennials grew up in a rapidly changing economic and social environment.", "The word \u201cmillennial\u201d is not used as frequently in China as it is in the West. Instead, Chinese usually refer to the groups of people between 20 and 35 years old as \u201cpost-80s\u201d, \u201cpost-90s\u201d, or even \u201cpost-95s\u201d. This demographic was born right after China opened up, kicking off economic reform in\u00a01978. These generations have witnessed the dramatic transformation of the country from a closed and poor nation to now the world\u2019s second largest economy that has both benefited and suffered from globalization and economic integration. Many panelists, thus, said that living and growing up in such a rapidly changing economic and social environment gives Chinese millennials a number of unique characteristics. Even though the emergence of digital technologies have a huge impact on their purchasing decisions and consumer behaviors, the innate economic and social factors that shape their values and consumption culture cannot go unnoticed.", "2. Chinese millennials are the world\u2019s most ultra-connected consumers.", "Denise Sabet, the managing director at Labbrand, said at a session that she found \u201cChinese millennials want to be always online.\u201d Indeed, young people are extremely adept at making use of fragmented time to be online. Ranging from the morning/evening commute, bathroom breaks, to pre-sleep, the majority of Chinese millennials spend a significant amount of time checking their mobile phones. This represents a need for them to stay connected with the world through the internet and social media, and brands should consider how they can gain millennials\u2019\u00a0attention within such short and fragmented periods.", "3. Chinese millennials participate in a unique commercial ecosystem that is dominated by e-commerce.", "It is well known that nearly every digital product and service in the West, be it Facebook, Google, Airbnb, or Uber, has\u00a0a counterpart in China. This has made it harder for foreign brands to do businesses in China, but that is not the only challenge. A speaker from Hot Pot Digital, a China digital marketing firm, noted that unlike in the U.S., e-commerce entirely defines the business ecosystem in China, as it almost appears in every step of the consumption process of Chinese millennials. The company estimates that China will represent about 60 percent of all global e-commerce transactions by 2020.", "4. Chinese millennials are eager to be seen as global citizens.", "Brands should not ignore the eagerness of Chinese millennials to show friends and families their close connection to the rest of the world. The relevance of this fact to foreign brands is that young Chinese people are now increasingly enthusiastic about knowing and buying standout\u00a0and niche brands\u00a0that can demonstrate their one-of-a-kind\u00a0tastes and distinguish them from others. Sabet from Labbrand said\u00a0\u201ceducating Chinese millennials is still an important part for foreign brands that hope to succeed in China.\u201d"]}, {"title": "Alibaba\u2019s \u201cNew Retail\u201d Model: A Better Omni-Channel Experience for Luxury Consumers?", "meta": "March 1, 2017", "paragraphs": ["In just a few years, the explosive development of the e-commerce industry in China has led to the revolutionary transformation of the ways in which luxury brands do business there.

The consolidation of a media and entertainment system combining control and commercialization during the rule of former President Hu Jintao (2002-2012) created the dual constituencies of the Party-state and the public. With the removal of state subsidies, but not state restrictions on content, the media and entertainment industries were compelled to adopt advertising-led business models while keeping content within deliberately vague and moving boundaries set by the Party-state. Commercial soft entertainment formats (pop music, chat shows, reality TV, action movies) were generally a safe way of achieving both ends, with insatiable demand arising from Chinese audiences used to and tired of a diet of serious but dull political fare.", "Expanded media and entertainment scenes provided opportunities for outside celebrities, particularly actors and singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan, to establish themselves in China.

This celebrity soft power is derived from carefully packaged looks, persona, lifestyles\u2014and often the merging together of artistic roles and reality. It is their attractiveness as aspirational symbols that underpin the Party-state\u2019s regulation and instrumentalization of celebrities. The celebrity industry operates within an interlinked commercial, technological, legal and political structure, with official discourses embedding celebrity culture in broader narratives around patriotism, progress, and stability. Guided from on high within the Party by the Central Publicity Department, the Ministry of Culture and the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television decide who performs when, where, and under what circumstances, and have the power to determine celebrity appearances across the Chinese media-scape, including prohibiting media from featuring \u201ccelebrities embroiled in scandals.\u201d In 2008, for instance, the Party banned media coverage of Tang Wei (\u6c64\u552f), a Chinese actress who starred in Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee\u2019s (Li An \u674e\u5b89) Lust, Caution (Se, Jie \u8272, \u6212) after the film was criticized by the central government for \u201cglorifying traitors and insulting patriots.\u201d As this case suggests, Chinese celebrity is deeply embedded within the Party\u2019s nationalistic project after 1989, when a democracy movement centered on Tiananmen Square presented the Party with its most direct challenge since its rise to power. Actress Zhang Ziyi (\u7ae0\u5b50\u6021), whose global stardom is predicated on having become the embodiment of the new, global China was similarly censured for playing the paramour of a Japanese man in Memoirs of a Geisha, a Hollywood production of an American novel.

A great majority of musicians and actors attended a state conservatory, dance, or drama academy, which act as incubators for the industry talent pool. Actresses Gong Li (\u5de9\u4fd0) and Zhang Ziyi (\u7ae0\u5b50\u6021) each was famously discovered by film director Zhang Yimou (\u5f20\u827a\u8c0b) while attending Beijing\u2019s Central Academy of Drama (Zhang graduated from the Beijing Film Academy). Action movie stars Jet Li (\u674e\u8fde\u6770) and Jackie Chan honed their trademark martial arts skills at academies for wushu and drama.

Chinese celebrities endorse everything from DeBeers diamonds (Zhao Wei \u8d75\u8587) to White Rabbit Acne Cream (G.E.M. \u9093\u7d2b\u68cb), with some individuals representing a dozen or more brands. Numerous Chinese celebrities, including actresses Li Bingbing (\u674e\u51b0\u51b0) and Zhou Xun (\u5468\u8fc5), and Olympian Liu Xiang (\u5218\u7fd4), have gained global recognition as representatives for Gucci, Chanel, and Nike respectively. Celebrity endorsements are closely monitored by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce under its Code of Advertising Ethics. The national Advertising Law, first launched in 1995, was updated in 2015 to include liability provisions for celebrity appearances in advertisements. Failure to comply can result in fines, confiscated fees, or bans from acting as a product spokesperson. The law is a response to numerous celebrity endorsements that were misleading or connected to faulty products. A notorious case involved infant formula produced by the state-owned Sanlu Group (\u4e09\u9e7f\u96c6\u56e2) that was tainted with melamine and killed six and harmed 300,000 children in 2008.

The celebrity wedding provides an illustration. When actress/ballerina Liu Shishi (\u5218\u8bd7\u8bd7) married Taiwanese singer/actor Nicky Wu (Wu Qilong \u5434\u5947\u9686) in March, it was widely reported across all major media outlets and was an extensive trending topic on social media.

However, when starlet Angelababy (\u6768\u9896) married actor Huang Xiaoming (\u9ec4\u6653\u660e) in 2015, the groom was forced to defend the extravagance of the ceremony held at Shanghai Exhibition Center, which featured 2,000 guests, a three meter-high cake, a five-carat diamond ring, and cost a reported $31 million.

Traditionally, the value of a customer is defined by financial segmentation. You purchase X USD/RMB worth of items a year, you are a VIP customer. You don\u2019t, you are a regular customer. This mantra more or less worked for decades, until the digital and mobile revolution illustrated by WeChat in China (or Kakao, Line, and WhatsApp elsewhere) changed the game and the way consumers interact with one another. Closed messaging\u00ad-app platforms have surpassed public social\u00ad media platforms (Weibo, Renren, Facebook, Twitter), forcing companies to adapt themselves to a new eco\u00adsystem.", "Having said that, users in China are what we call \u201cearly adopters.\u201d They test, digest, and adopt any technological trends faster than anyone can imagine. Hence, they change their minds quickly. Brand loyalty suffers because this pool of 650 million internet users in China has different expectations when it comes to brand engagement. They have an average 250 contacts on their WeChat accounts each, interact daily with about 20 of them and follow around 10 brands or corporate accounts. They belong to between five and 10 groups where their contacts share similar interests or passions (sport, media, food, travel, fashion, etc.). They barely open their professional mailboxes anymore as they are probably filled with advertising that is not relevant to their profiles.

As online acquisition costs are rocketing, a CRM mindset is the right strategy to \u201cfidelise\u201d your existing customer base and increase repetitive purchase. When Facebook generates 85 percent of its revenue from advertising, Tencent will make this same 85 percent with added CRM services. Once you have identified your best customers based on their daily activities (account clicks, content checked, number of chats) and campaign activities (to whom they share content, how many times), you will be able to map their social influence networks. Here comes the question: how can I recruit more customers if I rely on my existing ones? The answer is simple: by turning these influencers into brand ambassadors.", "", "2.

There are only 24 hours per day, and the key to get the most of a messaging app like WeChat is to use it as a tailored, direct communication channel to premium customers.

Good retail space is hard-to-find and expensive, and you\u2019ll need a vast marketing budget to make an impact right now. Unless the appetite for your brick-and-mortar stores is clear in China, take a wait-and-see approach.", "Target: Instead of looking to change the consumer culture in China, take advantage of consumer trends. If Chinese consumers are making the vast majority of luxury purchases outside of China, sell to them outside of China.\u00a0For smaller brands in the UK, it\u2019s probably a better idea to build relationships with UK-based students, more sophisticated regular visitors, and part-time residents, who will then influence their friends and family back home.", "Tag: Many brands struggle with their pricing strategy for China, but whether they cut prices 20 percent in Beijing or not, brands will continue to see the majority of Chinese shoppers buy luxury goods abroad. In reality, a significant number of Chinese shoppers are less concerned with price than they are about\u00a0value, meaning the brands that offer the best service and perks, and whose CRM fosters a loyal relationship, will remain popular regardless of pricing strategy.", "Avery Booker is a partner at\u00a0China Luxury Advisors.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "From \u2018About\u2019 China to \u2018For\u2019 China: Met\u2019s New Fashion Exhibit Marks End of Orientalist Era for Western Designers", "meta": "April 29, 2015", "paragraphs": ["A China-exclusive dress created by Valentino and presented in Shanghai in 2013 that will be on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute\u2019s \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass\u201d Exhibit.

Rather, it\u2019s mainly about the way Western designers interpret Chinese culture, or \u201ca China that exists as a collective fantasy.\u201d\u00a0As the Met points out in its description of the event, much of this fantasy was driven by classic films set in 1920s, 30s, and 40s China\u2014and these often had highly problematic themes. For example, Suzie Wong\u00a0 is commonly criticized for racism and sexism,\u00a0while films starring famous Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong often portrayed her as either a \u201cpainted doll\u201d or a \u201cscheming dragon lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "An evening gown by Roberto Cavalli based on Chinese porcelain that will be on display at the Costume Institute\u2019s new exhibit, \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass.\u201d (Metropolitan Museum of Art)", "While many of the dresses being displayed don\u2019t go full-on \u201cdragon lady\u201d and often just take inspiration from films actually by Chinese directors or from Chinese artwork, most of the ones revealed so far do represent the sartorial equivalent of Orientalism, a term which historically referred to the study of a broad swath of territory referred to as the \u201cOrient,\u201d including Asia and the Middle East. When professor Edward Said published his groundbreaking book Orientalism in 1978, he pointed out the problematic side of works of art or literature deemed \u201cOrientalist,\u201d noting that they often relied on patronizing racial stereotypes of \u201cexotic\u201d or \u201cmystical\u201d \u201cEastern\u201d cultures that often portrayed them as static and backward. According to Said, Orientalism was out of touch with on-the-ground realities in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, despite being part and parcel of Europe\u2019s colonial enterprises in those places. In a recent interview with Vogue, Bolton agreed that many of the dresses on display at the exhibition fit the rubric of Orientalism, but he argues this isn\u2019t a negative when it comes to fashion because it represents \u201can exchange of ideas and an honored source of influence.\u201d", "For the fashion designers with pieces on display, it will ultimately be wealthy Chinese consumers who make the final judgment call on this issue\u2014with their wallets. Even if certain designs with Chinese elements don\u2019t come across as offensive, they won\u2019t resonate with consumers if they show a lack of understanding of Chinese culture. China can no longer exist just in fashion labels\u2019 fantasies if they want to stay in business, and the perception that a garment is culturally tone-deaf will now lead directly to decreased profits. Over the past decade, Chinese luxury spending has grown tenfold and represented 30 percent of the global luxury market in 2014, according to Altagamma and Bain. This has been a rapid and groundbreaking change, since they accounted for only 3 percent only 10 years earlier (a time when many of the dresses at the exhibit were created). That number is just the average, and is much higher for some fashion brands\u2014Chinese consumers make up 38 percent of Prada\u2019s customer base, 37 percent of Gucci\u2019s, and 35 percent of Bottega Veneta\u2019s and Burberry\u2019s, according to estimates from Exane BNP Paribas.", "Designers have already become acutely aware of this shift, and the exhibit itself makes this clear. For example, it features a 2013 dress created by Valentino as part of an 85-piece capsule collection exclusively for the China market, which was presented in a special Shanghai runway show. Rather than featuring outfits that looked like they belong on the set of a culturally insensitive 1960\u2019s movie about 1920\u2019s-era Shanghai, the collection gave a nod to Chinese aesthetics with a red color palette while presenting pieces that were realistically wearable by the average urban Chinese fashionista.", "In a recent interview with Bolton published in Vogue, designer John Galliano noted that he has made this shift consciously since he began including Chinese motifs in his designs decade ago. \u201cI was fascinated with the culture. In retrospect, I think it was because I knew very little about it. Before I visited China, it was the fantasy that drew me to it, the sense of danger and mystery conveyed through Hollywood,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cmuch later, I learned more about the real China through research\u2014paintings, literature, architecture. My design process involves in-depth research, and I make a scrapbook for every collection with images that show my current thinking.

Nonetheless, there are many luxury brands on each type of account: Burberry, Gucci, and Audi all have subscription, while Jaeger LeCoultre, Louis Vuitton, and Piaget have service. There are several key differences to each that brands must carefully consider when setting up their official account, including how many messages they want to push out and what kind of e-commerce capabilities they need.", "Official account registration for foreign companies. To set up an official WeChat account, foreign companies need to check up on their eligibility to apply based on their authorization to do business in China.

Now that we\u2019re in November 2014, two years later, it\u2019s fair to consider that the bulk of the clean-out is broadly behind us and there are even signs of a slight pick-up in watch demand in China now as growth has become the reflection of true underlying sales driven by personal gifting and self-purchasing, not corporate gifting. In other words, the re-set has occurred in my view. To be fair, outside of watches and spirits, corporate gifting for most luxury sub-sectors was only accounting for a very small portion of overall sales.", "There are many factors explaining the strong growth prospects of Chinese luxury sales, of which:", "But above all, I believe the main driver for future growth of luxury sales to the Chinese is travel. Seventy-five percent of purchases are made outside of the mainland, but oddly enough, this may just be the very beginning given that only 4 percent of mainlanders hold passports (around 50 million people).

In handbags, there has been a shift from plastic/canvas to leather, and yes, from logo-heavy to logo-light or logo-less products. The search for more discretion has made many brands re-think their product assortments and has also influenced the design of the products themselves. Watches have become thinner, handbags less loud.", "But think of it as an evolution, not a revolution. It would be wrong to think that logos are dead. The recent Louis Vuitton monogram campaign, a highlight for the upcoming Holiday season, for which the brand worked with six different talents (some of the world\u2019s most celebrated designers, architects, artists, fashion gurus) to re-interpret its legacy range of monogram is proof that many consumers will still want to carry products that enable immediate social recognition.", "Beyond the logo debate, what will drive sales, in my view, is the shift of focus from Chinese towards other holistic experiences, better food, health, travel, and so on, which means they are developing a value-for-money approach which will put pressure on the traditional European luxury brands.", "As China\u2019s domestic luxury market slows, it\u2019s difficult to discern how much it\u2019s slowing due to the government\u2019s anti-graft policies and how much is due to other factors.

The up-and-coming category and the one I find the most exciting for the long run is high-end jewelry as Chinese consumption becomes more female-driven and self-purchasing habits develop on top of the traditional consumption for the big events of life (weddings, births, etc.) for which the well established Hong Kong and China jewelers selling gold and jade (Chow Tai Fook, Luk Fook) should remain dominant. Barriers to entry in jewelry are theoretically low but a piece of jewelry, unlike a handbag, is an investment and demands from the consumer a significant amount of trust.

It is likely that a main reason for the lagging growth has been Chinese consumers\u2019 growing sophistication and shifting preferences away from logo-heavy designs, as these brands have made efforts to increase their number of logo-free products and worked to avoid overexposure.", "This growing sophistication is emphasized in the fact that smaller niche labels as well as \u201cmasstige\u201d brands have fared significantly better in both the third quarter and the previous first half of the year. While Kering did not earn much revenue from Gucci, its smaller brands posted double-digit Greater China growth for the third quarter, with Bottega Veneta bringing in 30 percent and Stella McCartney,\u00a0Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and others collectively averaging 14 percent growth. Meanwhile, the more affordable \u201cmasstige\u201d category has also seen success, as Coach saw a 35 percent jump in sales for the third quarter.", "These substantial growth numbers are taking place because Chinese consumers are buying these products for themselves or for family and friends\u2014not for corrupt \u201cgifting\u201d purposes. As a continued stream of new anti-corruption efforts demonstrates, Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-graft crackdown is also still in high gear, and hitting many luxury sectors most associated with corruption or ostentatious displays of wealth that have been getting officials in trouble. For example, Swiss watch exports to China continue to decline, high-end liquor sales are still slumping, flashy car companies such as Ferrari and Lamborghini are seeing lower sales, and banquet foods such as shark-fin soup are in trouble.", "This downturn contrasts sharply with the aforementioned growth of successful fashion brands, as well as that of other consumer-oriented sectors such as beauty and mass luxury cars. Although LVMH was disappointed in its Louis Vuitton numbers, it said growth was strong in China for BeneFit cosmetics and Sephora sales. Meanwhile, China\u2019s wealthy apparently aren\u2019t worried about being too ostentatious if they drive an Audi or a BMW, as Volkswagen\u2019s China sales rose 18 percent from the beginning of the year until September, and BMW\u2019s grew by 20.8 percent.", "The bottom line for the luxury sector is that the numbers show that even if China\u2019s slowdown is long-term, brands with the right marketing strategies and an understanding of Chinese luxury consumers can still experience solid growth.

Additionally, luxury CEOs recognize that China\u2019s expected GDP growth rate of 7.5 percent is still comparably high, and previously skyrocketing rates merely reflected unsustainable numbers.", "In addition, companies worried about China growth should take a look at the global picture: Chinese customers may not be buying as much luxury at home, but they\u2019re certainly spending it abroad as the world\u2019s largest-spending bloc of tourists.

As a result of the diversity of these reasons, not all luxury brands are experiencing the slowdown in the same way: while the growth of low-key designers such as Bottega Veneta and lifestyle brands such as Coach has remained high in China, mega-brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci are striving to regain their high numbers from previous years.", "However, Chinese tourists are still way ahead of the pack in terms of global luxury consumption, meaning a great deal of that North American growth is going to be driven by their purchases. The study finds that Chinese consumers represent 29 percent of all luxury consumers in 2013, and most of those purchases are made outside the mainland thanks to high tariffs on foreign luxury products. A recent report by A.T.

Recent trends indicate that\u00a0Chinese\u00a0families have more money to spend on education and are more concerned with ensuring their child\u2019s success rate at getting into university. This has caused the average testing age for the TOEFL exam to drop, and China Daily reported that last year, the number of those under 18 taking the language test rose by 30 percent.

As you know, everyone has his or her own way of dealing with homesickness. I quite often like to indulge my sweet tooth when I\u2019m missing home; that seems to do the trick, although not a long-term solution! Or sometimes I go to Chinatown for a typical\u00a0Chinese meal that will remind me of home, or a simple snack from the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0supermarket. Over the past year I have been lucky to make additional friends from outside university at my local church; they have become like family.", "What are the things you value the most in your student accommodation?", "Friendly neighbors or roommates are a must! Last year, I had an American neighbor who was lovely, and the fact that she wasn\u2019t\u00a0Chinese\u00a0meant I was forced to practice my English. It improved drastically as we spent lots of time chatting together after class. We are still great friends today despite not living together anymore. Being able to cook is also very important, especially when living with students from other nationalities as you can learn about foreign foods, and most importantly, how to make your favorite foreign dishes.", "Where are you living and how did you choose your accommodation?", "I am living at The Costume Store, 160 Victoria Road, London W3 6UL,\u00a0which is managed by The Student Housing Company. The property has an exclusive agreement with my university to house students at Central Saint Martins so we are all design students here and I was given priority to live here.", "The most important thing to me when selecting accommodation is the location and how safe the area is.

This year, my accommodation is right next to the tube station, a 30-second walk, so it makes everything much easier and I have much more peace of mind.", "Another important aspect to consider is transport: the nearest tube station to my accommodation is North Acton, which is on the Central Line. Even though it is zone 2/3, the direct link on the tube means I can get to Oxford Street in about 20 minutes.", "Finally, cost is a major influencer, especially in a high-cost city like London. Students have to make the choice between location and quality. Sometimes you will sacrifice quality to be in a central location at a cost that fits your budget, or else you can go further out and get the quality and space you like that comes with a longer commute to university. Each student will have their own agenda and has to make the best choice according to their own preference.", "As a student in London, what are top 3 the items you cannot live without?", "Where do you think is the best place to live in London for students?\u00a0", "If I were to ignore the cost, I would say Angel is the best place to live. Angel is on the Northern line on the underground, which means it has excellent direct links to UCL and UAL and the other University of London campuses. There are also plenty of bus routes that link directly to popular destinations in central London such as Chinatown and Oxford Street. The four largest supermarkets are all found in Angel (Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks & Spencer, and Waitrose) along with high street stores, a cinema, and an art store.", "What is the coolest student accommodation building in London?", "I have not yet been there as it yet to open but from what I hear from my friends, Scape Greenwich is an amazing property.

I first noticed it on a\u00a0Chinese\u00a0soap opera called My Lucky Star and I realized I really like the hexagram they use for the logo. In fact, I did some research on their website and I noticed that all their pens have the iconic hexagram on the cap. I also like their jewelry design as I think it is accessible for younger adults like myself, while the pens are more appropriate gifts to give to a professional or say, your father.", "Clothing-wise, at this point in my life, I would say the only designer brand I would like to spend money on is DKNY as it is probably the most accessible for my student budget. I also think the style is suitable to younger adults. I did some research about the brand before and I learned that the designer and founder is a mother who started because she wanted to design clothes for her daughter. I find that a really lovely story behind the brand and it definitely attracts me to the label.", "Where do you learn about luxury brands? What influences you the most? Friends? Magazines? Online?", "I\u2019m a student at Central Saint Martins where many famous fashion designers originated, such as Alexander McQueen, Zac Posen, Matthew Williamson, and many more.

My colleagues also influence me a lot when we have discussions in class.", "What are your shopping habits like while living in London? Favorite stores? How often do you shop?", "I adore the boutique shops around Covent Garden and this is where I usually shop in London. I find the designs in these boutique stores are far more original and interesting. I usually go shopping at least once a week. Even if I am only browsing, I enjoy shopping around and seeing what\u2019s in stores.

Particularly when I went to Bicester Village at the Burberry Outlet Store, I think 60 percent of the customers were\u00a0Chinese. I\u2019m not sure what luxury brands can do to better understand us. I would say to actually take the time to do so would be a good start. Not just think about selling logos to us all the time, but really think about our lifestyle and culture.", "Do you travel during the year? If so, where do you go?", "Not yet. But I\u2019m planning to go Italy this year or next year. That\u2019s a haven for design students. I really want to visit the first Gucci Store in Florence.", "What do you think the travel industry should do to better understand the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0traveler?", "I think when the travel industry should have a specific, unique plan for target travelers. Some travelers may be interested in history and may just want to visit famous buildings from the outside. For young travelers, they mostly often just want to go shopping so this should be taken into consideration. In fact, this is a really important point for people to understand.

Therefore, on Weibo, many international luxury brands are constantly interacting with \u201ccapital V\u201d users who have huge numbers of fans. Some examples are Louis Vuitton and Fan Bingbing, Chanel and Yao Chen, and Coach and Leehom Wang. Major celebrity brand ambassadors are not the only focus for international brands, which also interact with popular \u201cinternet famous\u201d users on Weibo.

The brand entered into a collaboration with \u201cAstrology Vivian\u00a0(\u661f\u5ea7\u5c08\u5bb6\u8587\u8587\u5b89),\u201d a famous Weibo user with almost 6 million fans and the coveted capital V.

Psychologically, social media is now more of a soft sell, which can lead to certain challenges of its own. On one hand, brands want to promote themselves and have a lasting impact on their audience. Too much advertisement can jeopardize the fun of using Weibo, so a brand\u2019s\u00a0goal should be to advertise without boring its audience. An inundation of ads on Weibo can lead to a loss of fans, so many brands\u2019 official Weibo accounts are now more like official mini-websites which display the label\u2019s brand culture and products.", "Coach\u2019s WeChat account.", "As mentioned on Fashionbi, the introduction of the Tencent Wechat public platform is changing social media networking in China. As Weibo was reaching its peak in August 2012, Tencent WeChat offered an innovative form of internet social interaction, and many brands started to develop and expand on this much more private and mobile network. After only a short half-year, brands including Louis Vuitton, Coach, Gucci, and many other major fashion and luxury brands joined this platform.", "Among these brands, Louis Vuitton\u2019s development of social media in China has been much stronger than its efforts internationally. According to Fashionbi magazine, in October 2010, this brand was an early bird, opening an account on Sina Weibo as an official advertisement platform. Taking the strategy seriously, the company went local by selecting its Chinese name Luyi Weideng\u00a0(\u8def\u6613\u5a01\u767b). Later, in November 2012, the French luxury brand led the rest of its peers by joining the Wechat public platform in Sina Weibo, in contrast to competitors who thought that Wechat and Tencent Weibo users were too \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201clow-consumption.\u201d Louis Vuitton, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t resist reaching the 200 million WeChat users and an increasing number of mobile clients. It can be seen that the first well-known international brands to use the platform were quite optimistic about Chinese social networks.", "As marketing on Weibo brand accounts and use of celebrities increasingly spreads, and as the use of WeChat expands, there is no doubt that a direct and friend-style private interactive experience between the brand and brand followers can be established.

Yet despite developments like the government-led crackdown on conspicuous consumption by officials \u2014 a development largely led by online scandals \u2014 as well as a shakeout in the Chinese e-commerce market, more luxury purchases being made overseas, and more discerning auction buying by new Chinese art and wine collectors, 2012 was less a break from in 2011 and more an intensification of its macro-level trends. However, this doesn\u2019t mean 2012 was simply a natural continuation of 2011. Despite strong marketing pushes and more brick-and-mortar expansion into China this year, many brands saw more restrained buying among mainland Chinese consumers than in years past, indicating that economic fluctuations and slower economic growth in China could indeed be crimping demand. At the same time, more scrutiny on government officials\u2019 buying and gift-giving habits hit some brands harder than others, with several watchmakers and winemakers in particular seeing a dip in sales in the second half of the year.", "Still, despite a somewhat tougher year, most luxury brands remain optimistic about China, and for good reason. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, Prada sales in China leapt 33 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of the year, with the brand also attributing a 54 percent year-on-year increase in its Europe sales to Chinese tourists. Even at the end of this summer, as some brands showed a steep decline in sales, others such as Herm\u00e8s and L\u2019Oreal, and luxury groups LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and PPR, boasted double-digit growth that defied observer fears of a sharp China drop-off. Recently, the Boston Consulting Group asserted that China will have surpassed the United States as the second-largest personal luxury market by 2015, accounting for $87 billion, 23 percent of the global market, and become the largest personal luxury market by 2020. Others, such as Bain, hold that China has already become the world\u2019s largest luxury market.", "The Long Museum, China's largest private museum, recently opened in Shanghai", "In China\u2019s art market, which overtook the United States to become the world\u2019s largest art and antiques market in terms of auction and dealer sales in 2011, according to The European Fine Art Foundation, 2012 was also a more complex year for major auction houses. However, a hopeful sign for international players like Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, and increasingly global Chinese houses like China Guardian and Beijing Poly, is that Chinese collectors have not lost their appetite for high-priced, top-tier art and antiques. While demand for blue-chip Western art remains highly niche in auction hubs like Hong Kong, mainland Chinese collectors have continued to home in on well-known traditional Chinese ink painters, modernist \u201cbrand-names,\u201d and blue-chip contemporary Chinese artists even as bidding and buying has become more selective.

While the recent anti-corruption drive could dent luxury segments most often used for gift-giving purposes, one thing to keep in mind is that China is large, diverse, populous, and has a massive rising middle class that wants (often very conspicuous) high-end brands. In the year ahead, look for the inland middle-class, second-tier entrepreneurs, the stereotypical \u201ccoal bosses\u201d and other emerging luxury buyers within China to remain conspicuous in their consumption. Also, don\u2019t expect powerful, wealthy demographics in power centers like Beijing to stop buying luxury goods in 2013 after years of doing so.

Top-Tier Consumers Going Obscure Amid Greater Scrutiny", "Though newly wealthy shoppers in second-, third- and fourth-tier cities may just be buying their first Louis Vuitton wallet in 2013, greater scrutiny among co-workers or superiors will continue to drive China\u2019s top-tier consumers towards boutique or obscure luxury brands.

The Promise of Luxury E-Commerce Still Largely Unrealized", "If China\u2019s luxury market as a whole became more complicated this year, its nascent luxury e-commerce market became even more so. Following a raft of investment and new entrants to the nebulous market in 2011, competition became far greater over the course of a turbulent 2012, with American and European heavyweights such as Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus and Net-A-Porter hitting the market with full-price, O2O models for China and teaming up with Chinese luxury sites\u00a0including VIPStore\u2019s\u00a0Omei,\u00a0Glamour Sales, and\u00a0Shouke. At the same time, individual brands like Coach, Zara, and J. Crew (in partnership with Lane Crawford) expanded into the China e-commerce market.", "The Zara mainland China online store launched on September 5", "To compete, Chinese e-tailers spent the better part of the year prioritizing exclusive brand partnerships, with Shangpin\u00a0collaborating with the likes of Sergio Rossi, M Missoni, Diane Von Furstenberg and Stuart Weitzman\u00a0as well as\u00a0more niche American labels\u00a0like Cynthia Rowley, Laundry by Shelli Segal, Charlie Jade,\u00a0Tracy Reese\u00a0and\u00a0label Milly.

In 2013, we expect to see quite a few casualties, particularly among domestic Chinese e-tailers, and expect full-price O2O models to show the greatest potential, particularly in top-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Inland, discounts will remain a top priority for middle-class consumers, and as such the \u201cWild West\u201d atmosphere of the Chinese luxury e-tail market will likely stay intact.", "4.

Though we expect German brands Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz to continue to rule the high-end of the market in 2013, greater competition from their American and British counterparts, and the aforementioned greater scrutiny regarding government luxury purchases, could make the year ahead more difficult for perennial leaders like Audi in particular.", "China's wealthy red wine lovers have turned to Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti over the past year", "5. Chinese Wine Demand Making Some Burgundy Lovers See Red", "China\u2019s wine market also showed signs of continued maturation in 2013, as well as signs of overcapacity due to a glut of (not always professional) importers.

Thus, Burgundy wine may be facing opposite symptoms compared to cheese, as overwhelming Chinese investments are giving Burgundy drinkers everywhere a reason to fear a surge of speculative interest in the region and its wines. Burgundy\u2019s notoriously conservative wine-growers have also been alarmed by the growing interest in buying Burgundy real estate among Chinese investors.

As Hennig put it, lower (but still double-digit) growth rates show, to him at least, that the Chinese consumer is not cutting luxury spending completely out of his or her diet, but rather is thinking twice before making a major purchase.

VASTO, which currently operates\u00a0around 300 points of sale throughout China, as well as\u00a0shops in Switzerland and the Middle East and plans to expand to France and the US, positions itself as the \u201cBrooks Brothers of China,\u201d sells apparel,\u00a0Swiss-made watches, French-made pens and Italian\u00a0leather goods.

However, the \u201cstandardization\u201d as evidenced by similar looking malls with uniform global brand marketing campaigns is leveling the playing fields. Based on the development and penetration (of international) brands, the market is largely divided into first, second, third and even fourth tier areas. First tier markets include Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, which have modern infrastructure and a Westernized consumer. Other tier cities will include cities with a population of around 1 million each. Western brands usually enter China through tier one and two and then work their way down.", "It is amazing to already see particularly the presence of some of the Swatch brands (Tissot, Rado, Longines) in fourth tier areas. So the notion that there is still virgin territory with ignorant consumers can slowly be dismissed.", "IW: So are you saying that China is reaching saturation for luxury products?", "MB: No, on the contrary! There is still plenty of potential and it is forecasted that two-thirds of future wealth creation will particularly take place in tier three and four areas. What I mean to say is that consumers are becoming much more knowledgeable and you have to have a credible brand and story to tell. To a large extent this is the problem that many Chinese \u201cluxury\u201d brands are facing\u2014and there are many of them, from garments to luxury furniture. Many have been free-riding with adopted European sounding names or blatant copies of existing international brands\u2014some of the examples with derivatives of Gucci, Dior or Boss are almost funny and should keep trademark lawyers very busy.", "IW: But what is the quality like of these Chinese luxury brands?", "MB: Well, some of it is really quite good reaching similar levels as international brands. Actually, you would be surprised to see the high prices, but we can touch on this subject when we talk about the consumers. Again, many international brands already produce many of their items in China, so a certain know-how and savoir faire is present in the Chinese manufacturing base. What Chinese brands lack is instilling a story, a meaning and raison d\u2019\u00eatre in their products. In the past it was sufficient to pretend to be European, preferably with a blond and blue-eyed model advertising the product. Today, this marketing strategy is pass\u00e9. Consumers are asking questions and are generally more critical than in the past. Recently, there was a widely publicized scandal involving a luxury furniture maker that was selling high priced \u201cItalian Made Furniture\u201d that turned out to be low-end Chinese-made\u2014the company needed police protection to fend off angry consumers.", "IW: Tell us about the Chinese Consumer. What distinguishes them from American or European consumers?", "VASTO's roster includes Swiss-made watches and French-made pens", "MB: For many years, China has been the origin of mass-produced goods often at the lower quality end. So perhaps, the impression may be that Chinese consumers having grown up in this environment will not be as demanding as their Western counterparts. This is totally false! I have rarely seen more demanding and finicky consumers. Visitors to Hong Kong may have already observed expensive watches in the shop window wrapped in protective cling film. A Chinese buyer will literally take out a magnifying glass to ascertain that there are no marks of use. Due to the propensity of fakes (from products to bank notes) Chinese are particularly careful. Anecdotally, this is also the reason why in restaurants a chicken (or any other meat dish) will often be served with the head to prove the genuine product.", "On one hand, Chinese consumers will try to achieve a maximum discount, which is the reason why prices are often marked double the suggested price. On the other hand, things cannot be marked too cheap, as this would again raise suspicion that the quality was inferior or that the product may be fake. So setting the right price is a big challenge.", "In general, Chinese are much more \u201csuspicious\u201d about the quality and serviceability of a product.

While there are few surprises on the list, as auto brands dominate, as in other rankings such as last year\u2019s L2\u2019s Prestige 100 China IQ Report, some unexpected brands do show up.", "According to the study, 18 of the top 50 most-searched-for luxury brands in China, or 36 percent, are auto brands, unsurprisingly led by Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Though no real shocker to anyone following the China luxury market, as auto brands have been among the most aggressive in terms of advertising and expansion in China over the past 20 years, it does show that market potential for major auto brands remains strong among younger consumers in the country. In terms of fashion houses, again, Louis Vuitton \u2014 which has operated in mainland China since 1992 \u2014 is the most searched-for fashion brand and #3 luxury brand overall, followed by Chanel (#5) and Dior (#8). Interest for Dior is linked mostly to beauty, however, with more than 80 percent of Dior searches related to its cosmetics and fragrances. For Chanel, though, its beauty segment represents less than half of searches. For Louis Vuitton, 94 percent of searches were related to fashion & accessories, indicating that its luxury watch division has its work cut out in mainland China.", "One interesting finding is that the Hong Kong brand Chow Tai Fook is the most searched-for jewelry brand in China, followed by Cartier and Swarovski. Though, with more than 1,500 locations in 320 cities throughout the Greater China region, this isn\u2019t a jaw-dropping finding, it\u2019s surprising that brands such as Tiffany & Co. that are in the midst of major expansion and marketing efforts weren\u2019t more highly ranked.", "Another interesting aspect to the study was the fact that Chinese consumers don\u2019t uniformly search for luxury brands using the same Chinese-language transliterations. According to the ranking, when searching for \u201cBurberry,\u201d 76 percent of Chinese consumers used the brands unofficial Chinese name \u2014 \u5df4\u5b9d\u8389 or Ba b\u01ceo l\u00ec \u2014 while only 15 percent used its official Chinese name (\u535a\u67cf\u5229, B\u00f3 b\u01cei l\u00ec) and nine used its English name. For other brands with longer and more difficult names for Chinese consumers, such as Louis Vuitton, abbreviated names or acronyms are more widely used. In searches for Louis Vuitton, 63 percent were for \u201cLV\u201d rather than \u201cLouis Vuitton.\u201d Though the brand isn\u2019t ranked, we\u2019d expect similar numbers for searches of \u201cDVF.\u201d", "Moncler's Beijing Sanlitun location", "Though \u201cbig brands\u201d proliferate on the ranking, a few outliers indicate that Chinese consumers are gradually widening their awareness of more niche luxury brands. Just as Japanese and Korean luxury shoppers moved beyond LV and Gucci in the 1980s and 1990s, China\u2019s more sophisticated shoppers are increasingly searching for brands such as cosmetics label Borghese, whose face masks are developing a cult-like following in top-tier Chinese cities. The French outerwear brand Moncler, which currently has only seven locations in six cities in mainland China, is ranked 42nd on the list, beating the likes of Rolex and Ferragamo. American brand Anna Sui, despite a very niche fashion presence in the Chinese Mainland (with only one location in Hangzhou), is ranked 47th, owing to its massive beauty presence. Currently, Anna Sui operates 31 beauty counters in 16 cities.", "While the study doesn\u2019t delve too deeply into what actually drives these consumers to actively search for a given brand \u2014 television, print, Weibo, friends, etc. \u2014 it does give some valuable insight into the evolution of brand knowledge in China. A few years ago, we\u2019d expect the list to be filled from start to finish with the brands that have the most locations and most expensive ad campaigns in China.

Checking into the story, a photographer from the Apple Daily reported on January 5 that he was told by a security guard that only mainland Chinese or\u00a0foreign\u00a0tourists were allowed to take photos outside the store, with another guard allegedly threatening to break his camera. Within hours, the story had\u00a0set off a firestorm of criticism in the city, with angry Hong Kong locals taking to Facebook to speak out about what they saw as tantamount to discrimination, leaving hundreds of messages on Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s wall demanding the brand apologize or pack up and leave Hong Kong altogether.", "Over the weekend, more than Facebook users in Hong Kong joined together to organize a protest of Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s Tsim Sha Tsui flagship, creating a \u201c10,000 People Photograph D&G Event\u201d (D&G\u9580\u53e3\u842c\u4eba\u5f71\u76f8\u6d3b\u52d5) page now \u201cliked\u201d by nearly 20,000 fans, with around 1,000 protestors actually taking to the streets yesterday. According to Hong Kong\u2019s Standard, the protest turnout was so great that the store was forced to shut its doors before 3:00 PM as the crowds gathered, with other shops nearby closing early as well as crowds spilled over. Protesters carried cameras and snapped photographs of the store as others held placards denouncing the photo ban and demanding an apology. Despite the massive turnout, as of last night Dolce & Gabbana had only issued a terse, unsigned statement rather than an apology, reading, \u201cWe wish to underline that our company has not taken part in any action aiming at offending the Hong Kong public.\u201d", "This is unlikely to assuage the protesters\u2019 anger in any way.

First off, despite the importance of Hong Kong as a key market to benefit from growing mainland Chinese tourism, being perceived as \u201cplaying favorites\u201d to the detriment of locals should be avoided at all costs. Recent, racy photo-spreads (NSFW) in Beijing and rosy talk of their love for cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, and rumors in the Hong Kong press about mainland Chinese officials throwing their influence around at luxury boutiques only serves to stir the pot further.", "Another important thing for brands to remember in Hong Kong is that the city\u2019s more open press and Internet vis-a-vis the Mainland, and wide rate of English-language fluency, allows for PR issues to spread (arguably) more quickly and (certainly) more globally than they would in mainland China. The hundreds of angry comments now posted in English on Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s Facebook wall from Hong Kong attest to this. In contrast, other recent China-related PR crises \u2014 such as complaints by former workers at Gucci China that the brand was operating essentially a sweatshop in southern China \u2014 remained largely localized and were less widely reported in the global English-language\u00a0press.", "Dolce & Gabbana, photographed in Beijing late last year (Image: Prestige HK)", "Ignoring Hong Kong\u2019s Internet-mobilized sense of solidarity against what many perceive as belittlement is the worst thing a luxury brand can do, and as such every brand operating in Hong Kong (or, really, anywhere) needs a defined and localized crisis management plan. Taking the high rate of penetration of global social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter in Hong Kong (and the city\u2019s more open tabloid and online press) into consideration is key, as is the understanding of how locals are reacting to the influx of extremely wealthy mainland Chinese tourist-shoppers now populating shopping districts like Tsim Sha Tsui and Central.", "Whether the allegations against D&G in Hong Kong are actually true or not has become a secondary issue. The brand\u2019s failure to come out with at least an apology and a vow to investigate the claims within the first 24 hours of the initial article is now at the forefront.

This summer, scandal broke when a young woman, Guo Meimei, who claimed to work as general manager of the Red Cross Society of China, posted photos of her many luxury handbags and cars on Sina Weibo.

In the year ahead, we expect the adoption of \u201clow-key luxury\u201d to gain pace, particularly in economic and political power centers like Beijing and Shanghai.", "This progression is perhaps natural, and not terribly surprising, since lower-key luxury has been the name of the game in developed markets like Europe and North America since the financial crisis of 2008.

Coming off a whirlwind 2010, during which new Chinese collectors all but pushed the formerly dominant Western collectors of Chinese contemporary art completely out of the market and turned their attention to blue-chip Chinese artists like Zhang Xiaogang, Liu Ye, Zeng Fanzhi and Yue Minjun, this year\u2019s spring auctions in Hong Kong proved wildly successful. As the year drew to a close, autumn auctions by the likes of Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong continued to record strong sales, but after months of tightening credit and a property slowdown, the newest of the new Chinese collectors showed a more cautious and discerning streak, mostly buying the best pieces by top-tier Chinese contemporary artists and traditional Chinese paintings.", "Though many commentators were quick to conclude that fewer high-profile sales this autumn in Hong Kong indicated a slowdown in the Chinese contemporary art market, an ArtTactic survey published in November indicated that confidence in the market among domestic collectors remains far higher than that seen among American and European collectors. For well-known pieces by blue-chip Chinese artists like Zeng Fanzhi, Zhang Xiaogang, Zhou Chunya and Liu Ye, sales remained strong in 2011, but the more selective buying of Chinese collectors in the second half of the year indicates that the market is maturing quickly \u2014 a trend that is, by all measures, good for its development.

But in 2011, pushback against Beijing\u2019s high punitive luxury taxes hit fever pitch, with high-powered businesspeople like Wang Jianlin \u2014 chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group \u2014 assailing the central government\u2019s failure to spur domestic consumption and, in Wang\u2019s words, lead Chinese consumers to \u201c\u201csit on airplanes to deliver jobs and tax money to foreign countries.\u201d", "With high luxury taxes making everything from imported clothing to electronics around 45 percent more expensive in mainland China than in Hong Kong and 51 percent higher than in the U.S., public support for tax reform remains high.

While the Ministry of Commerce strongly supports tariff cuts to spur more Chinese consumers to shop domestically rather than jetting off to Hong Kong, New York or Paris for their luxury shopping sprees, the Ministry of Finance opposes the cuts.

It\u2019s a must to show social status through the price or displaying logos. This conception of consumption will change, but it needs more time. Shifts in Chinese industry come in gradients, so it\u2019s going to be the same in terms of consumption.

Blogs and social networking are important supplements for micro-blogs as well. It\u2019s very important to reach opinion leaders who can find the right brands and really like a certain set of brands on a personal level.

At Daqing New Mart, brands like Omega, Longines and Girard Perregaux are surrounded by supermarkets and shanzhai (\u5c71\u5be8) stores. Longines sits around 10 meters away from a supermarket, and Omega shares a wall with a McDonald\u2019s. Still, this hasn\u2019t reduced the city\u2019s enthusiasm for luxury goods. According to a staff briefing, Ulysse Nardin \u2014 which has been in the mall for a year \u2014 sold a Tourbillon watch worth 2 million yuan (US$315,000) last month, and Girard Perregaux has recorded good sales performance for watches ranging in price from 140,000-400,000 yuan.

Right now, Hong Kong\u2019s Wharf Holdings is building the International Financial Center (IFC) here, and I believe IFC Chengdu will attract even more top-tier brands. But there are other examples of the city\u2019s importance to luxury brands.

Although competition is becoming increasingly fierce, the luxury market in Chengdu should be getting better and better. The more stores open, the bigger the market will be.", "JD: In general, how do you perceive attitudes towards luxury among\u00a0Chinese consumers?", "OM: Generally speaking, I think their attitude towards shopping is relatively impulsive.

Do you think luxury consumers in Chengdu are more price-sensitive?", "OM: In my opinion, consumers who are able to afford luxury seldom complain about prices. They should have prepared themselves psychologically before hitting the mall, and have a rough sense of what they expect to spend. Moreover, the products they like to buy should be familiar to their friends and family. However, some customers have been known to complain about prices in Chengdu after buying similar items at a lower price in Hong Kong or overseas.

Also, some customers come to stores here to compare styles and sizes locally before shopping abroad. ", "JD: How do you feel about consumers here? What pushes someone to shop locally?", "OM: In Chengdu, many luxury brands put a lot of effort into retaining customers. Lots of brands have regular consumers who often spend a certain amount of money on particular products.

Included in the \u201cBEING\u201d exhibition was\u00a0Zeng\u2019s 2010 work \u201cThe Leopard,\u201d which was auctioned off for charity at the spring auctions, raising HK$36 million (US$4.6 million) for The Nature Conservancy.\u00a0After the auction, Christie\u2019s Asia president, Francois Curiel\u00a0pointed out that Zeng Fanzhi, the Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Foundation, Christie\u2019s, and the Rockbund Art Museum have been brought together to promote Chinese contemporary art as well as the concept of environmental charity to a global audience.", "Zeng\u2019s \u201cUntitled-Landscape\u201d will go up for auction at Sotheby", "With more of China\u2019s emerging collectors becoming interested in Zeng Fanzhi, particularly as his profile grows even more and he collects awards like Art Value\u2019s \u201cMost Influential Artist\u201d nod, Zeng\u2019s early works in particular are becoming scarcer. While Zeng oil-on-canvas works are already well into the multimillion-dollar category, we\u2019re already seeing pre-sale estimates for his comparatively inexpensive drawings and oil pastels show a significant rise at auctions in Hong Kong and elsewhere. At the Sotheby\u2019s Contemporary Asian Art auction on October 3, a 1997 colored pencil and pastel piece by Zeng is estimated to sell for HK$150,000-200,000 (US$19,300-25,700), well above the HK$65,000-100,000 ($8,400-12,900) pre-sale estimates for a 2004 drawing later sold at last fall\u2019s Contemporary Asian Art auction in Hong Kong for HK$375,000 ($48,100). Look for fierce bidding for the eight works by Zeng set to go under the hammer in Hong Kong next week, two of which Jing Daily featured in our \u201cTop 10 Lots to Watch.\u201d", "As competition for works by Zeng, along with other blue-chip painters, continues to heat up among established Chinese and international collectors as well as the new breed of inflation-motivated mainland Chinese bidders, expect these prices to continue going upward.

Zeng graduated from the Department of Oil Painting at the Hubei Academy of Fine Arts, later achieving notoriety and acclaim for his unique artistic language and sharp social criticism throughout the late 1990s.

In the first half of our interview, we covered Shang Xia\u2019s first anniversary, the burgeoning appreciation for Chinese design now spreading among more sophisticated urban Chinese, and her plans for brand expansion. Today, we wrap up by discussing the differences between Shanghainese and inland consumers, the development of new Shang Xia collections, and Jiang Qiong\u2019er\u2019s plans for the year ahead.", "Jing Daily (JD): I\u2019m curious about your thoughts on the luxury business in general here. It\u2019s a very fast-growing market, the fastest-growing in the world, but what\u2019s popular in Shanghai is different from what\u2019s popular in Beijing or Chengdu. Are people here more receptive to design like this compared to someone from another city?", "Jiang Qiong\u2019er (JQE): It\u2019s interesting that we only have one space here but we get many visitors from Beijing, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Qingdao, even Dalian and Hong Kong. From everywhere. And I think the market for Western luxury brands differs if we\u2019re talking about different areas of China, but since Shang Xia is inspired by Chinese culture, there\u2019s something shared among Chinese people. So finally, which is a very interesting point, you don\u2019t see a huge difference where Beijingers just love the furniture, or people from Dalian just love the textiles, it\u2019s quite balanced. You don\u2019t see this huge cultural difference between north and south. ", "I think maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re based on Chinese culture \u2014 they all love jade or zitan, or they all drink tea. But if you look at the market, you have few quality options in this field. You have replicas of Ming Dynasty furniture, with zitan wood, greatly done, or antiques. But you don\u2019t have traditional know-how, great quality, and contemporary design. So we are quite unique in this market. People from all over China, even from Hong Kong or Taiwan, share a lot in common in terms of appreciation of our collection in general.", "JD: How often do you add new collections?", "JQE: We have one collection every year, so next week we will debut the new collection. But each collection features a new topic. Apart from the debut of the new collections in September, we have three smaller waves of arrivals, in March, June and December. We don\u2019t fit in the Fashion Week rhythm, and we don\u2019t do fashion shows, because we\u2019re not a fashion brand. We\u2019re trying to create designs and collections that are timeless. Because the Ming dynasty furniture, the Northern Song dynasty porcelain, the Han dynasty dresses, we feel that these three dynasties are examples of timeless classic beauty. We want to re-translate this for today\u2019s world.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: Do you lead the development of new collections or does your team? How does it work?", "JQE: I choose the topic, the theme, and then I work with a design team. I develop the collection plan, though, and I\u2019m already thinking about 2013. I think two years in advance. Then, when the team is busy doing the actual collections, I\u2019m already two years ahead in terms of topic. I\u2019ve already settled on the topic of 2013.", "JD: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to tell me. (laughs)", "JQE: No. (laughs) I have to think far in advance, in terms of the collection plan. Because, like with the tea set we developed for our first collection, we have a long waiting list. It\u2019s one of our best sellers, because it\u2019s all hand woven, with bamboo. And it\u2019s not just decorative, it\u2019s functional. The white porcelain is fired at 1,380 degrees to make the porcelain look like white jade. Even Japanese masters fire their porcelain at 1,300 degrees, as every 10 degrees upward from that is a challenge. We have a long waiting list, because one teapot takes 10 days to make and even a small cup takes about two days. A full set takes one month to three months to produce.", "JD: And it\u2019s just one person who makes that? Or it\u2019s a team?", "JQE: One person weaves the bamboo, from start to finish. In all, we only have five or six artisans working on that. So customers have to wait to get the set, but they prefer to wait. They insist on waiting. So that\u2019s why this type of collection won\u2019t take off.", "JD: In terms of collections, do you try to keep a balanced number of items in each category, like furniture, jewelry, clothing, or do you sometimes want to do more of one type?", "JQE: For our new collection, I only added two pieces of furniture, because we have a basic line of eight pieces, and I added two very special pieces. One of them is the \u201cDa Tian Di\u201d tea ceremony table. We made that because there\u2019s nothing like it on the market for people to drink gong fu tea elegantly. You\u2019ll go to a friend\u2019s house, and even if they\u2019re really wealthy, on their beautiful table they have to sit a little wooden tea set with an electric tea kettle, with the cable hanging down, and a plastic hot water bottle. And it\u2019s just not elegant, even though you\u2019re drinking some of the best tea in the world. So what we designed is a beautiful tea ceremony drinking system that\u2019s modular. When you\u2019re using it, it unfolds, and when you\u2019re not, it all folds back in. It\u2019s got an ink stone from Anhui on which you prepare your tea. And we prepared an integrated heater for the tea kettle, plus the cable is hidden. You don\u2019t even see it. So when you\u2019re not using it, it\u2019s still a beautiful table.", "Another piece I added to the new collection is a rocking chair. It takes one year to produce one piece, and it\u2019s made of zitan wood. The magic of this piece is that when you\u2019re lying on it, it will only stop rocking if your heart stops. It\u2019s very sensitive. Today, you need to slow down a bit, take your time to think, to rest, so this design is meant to help with that. But we use traditional know-how, without any nails or joints.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: I know that different things in your collection are made in different places. Where are your furniture collections made?", "JQE: Several places: Zhejiang province, Fujian province. Because different areas have different kinds of wood. We use bamboo from Sichuan, from Jiangxi province, Jiangsu, everywhere. We get some raw materials from Tibet, and we\u2019ve been working with people in Guizhou to get materials, but we\u2019re taking our time with that because most of the products there have a minority, ethnic style, which we aren\u2019t looking for. We want to re-translate their know-how in a contemporary way.", "JD: I know some brands try to do designs that are inspired by Chinese minority groups. I\u2019m wondering if people are interested in that here, or if they tend to prefer things that are more readily understandable.", "JQE: Yes, because if you use these kinds of Chinese elements, you can get to the market in a shorter time, but then it\u2019s just a fashion trend. Then people get bored with it after a year or two and move on. We try to make new translations and interpretations of culture that are more timeless. It takes us a lot longer than others. For another brand, maybe they\u2019d complete the Guizhou cooperation in a year, but for us, we\u2019re two years in and we still don\u2019t think it\u2019s ready.", "JD: It seems like it\u2019s difficult to convince people in China to slow down, because with business and competition here it\u2019s always about speeding up. And I think you\u2019re one of the few people who\u2019s telling people to relax a little. How long do you think it\u2019ll take people to listen to that?", "JQE: Different people will take a different amount of time. Some very successful people only realize they need to slow down and enjoy their lives when they get sick. I think sometimes people need to wake up to it when something [bad] happens. Otherwise, just as a general social attitude, it\u2019ll take several generations.", "JD: Since you spent a great deal in time in France and have been close to the luxury market for years, what are some of your thoughts on people\u2019s relationship towards luxury goods here?", "JQE: I think 100 years ago, China had its own luxury brands: tailors, medicine, tea, jewelry, shoes, jade, famous artisans. Then we stopped, until probably the early 90s. Then the Western luxury brands came about 20 years ago. At that time, for the first 5-10 years it was very fresh and new. So the attitude was all about putting Chinese things aside. That\u2019s the first period.", "Then, about 10 years later, some people developed a more reasonable way of thinking. They didn\u2019t put all Chinese things aside. They weren\u2019t just buying based on name and price, they started to look at brand story and history, quality. Over the past three to five years, some of these customers have realized a need from their own cultural backgrounds. They started to wonder, for example, what kind of tea the emperors used to drink. I have a friend who\u2019s a great real estate developer. Once he said he found an artisan who restored a Qing emperor\u2019s furniture at the Forbidden City, and hired this man to create all of the furniture in his office from Qing Dynasty-era wood. He was really proud of it.", "So some Chinese people, after 20 or 30 years of being obsessed with Western brands, are starting to look inward. Which doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll quit the Western brands altogether. You can have both in your life. You can mix and match. It\u2019s not a competition; it\u2019s just a way of putting cultures together to suit your lifestyle.", "\u00a0", "", "JD: It seems like things progress first in Shanghai and Beijing, so maybe the people who encountered the Western luxury brands first are starting to move on while people in the interior of the country are often just getting to that first stage.", "JQE: It\u2019s interesting. We find that a lot of people from places like Chengdu know Shang Xia. They fly in from Chengdu, and they bring purchases from here back home. They love Shang Xia.", "JD: Do you think some people in second- and third-tier cities like the cultural items a bit more?", "JQE: Yes, they\u2019re different from Shanghainese. They have less Western influence. So they\u2019re already more rooted in Chinese soil. Their mentality is different from, like you said, Beijing or Shanghai. They\u2019re not \u201cbrainwashed\u201d yet.", "JD: Can you say something about your new collection, which is coming out this month?", "JQE: The collection is called \u201cHuman and Nature,\u201d so starting this September I\u2019m using a lot of natural materials like agate, bamboo, and zitan. The carved agate we\u2019re using has ancient plants pressed into it, which means it\u2019s more than 50,000 years old. It has to be carved from one piece of stone. We\u2019ve also got the zitan rocking chair. Also, we\u2019ve got our own mahjong set. When we told our friends we were doing it, we immediately sold out. Because Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dunhill, all of these brands did mahjong sets, but they just decorated the outer box with their logos. Inside, it was just plastic. On ours, we didn\u2019t stick the Shang Xia logo anywhere on the box, but each tile inside was individually designed in-house. On top of each tile is metal, and on the rear is sandalwood, so after you play mahjong for several hours, your hands smell like sandalwood. We even cast the coins you use to play in gold, silver and bronze. This is an object we\u2019re really proud of.", "On this year\u2019s catalog, we worked again with Paolo Roversi, and instead of using models, we invited our friends to \u201cmodel\u201d our new collection.", "JD: What are you doing differently this year in terms of clothing collections?", "JQE: We\u2019re using special pleated cashmere from Nepal and Tibet, so one dress takes about three months of hand-weaving to produce. We\u2019re also doing new collections of jewelry made of white jade, gold and zitan wood.", "JD: To wrap up, you\u2019ve been in business for one year. What would you say you\u2019re most proud of from the last year, and what are you looking forward to the most in the year ahead?", "JQE: I think what I\u2019m most proud of from the last year is the pride we see from Chinese people who come by the store, and the appreciation we see from people from overseas. This is what\u2019s made us proudest. And for the year ahead, I think we\u2019re most excited about our new collections. The objects themselves are always the most important. And if we have the opportunity to open in Paris, it will be very exciting, but we don\u2019t know exactly where and when. No matter what, it will be very exciting if we do it.", "The Jing Daily team would like to thank Jiang Qiong\u2019er, Shu Shu Chen and the Shang Xia team.

Arriving at Three at the Bund in 2002 from London, where he made a name for himself as the head of Sir Terence Conran\u2019s flagship restaurant, Mezzo, Laris led his pioneering Laris Restaurant from 2003-2010, paving the way in terms of building the market for contemporary fine dining in Shanghai. In 2008, he founded David Laris Creates (DLC), which has provided consulting and development services for clients such as Swire\u2019s Opposite House (Beijing) and East Hotel (Hong Kong (2010) and Beijing (2012)). Currently, Laris operates seven F&B concepts across 11 locations in Shanghai, including his Yucca Lounge, Mediterranean-infused Fat Olive, and most recently, 12 Chairs \u2014 \u201cone of the smallest fine dining restaurants in China.\u201d In October, Laris will open his first Chinese restaurant, Le Sheng (\u4e50\u7b19).

I\u2019d done Hong Kong and Macau, I\u2019d been in Vietnam. I felt China would be too hard, I\u2019m never gonna work there. (laughs) I\u2019d done the hard stuff. And then this awesome opportunity came up when I was in Singapore attending the World Gourmet Summit, I was cornered there by a team who said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come to Shanghai to see this building, because it\u2019s going to revolutionize hospitality in China.\u201d I came over and saw what at that time was the skeleton of Three on the Bund, which has, unfortunately, not become the icon it was a few years ago, but certainly for five, six years it reigned supreme about what China could be from an independent hospitality standpoint. I came in and fell in love with the building and got involved at a very early stage. I think, in terms of expats, I was number three or four, and this was a company that ended up having around 30 expats working for it, running Three on the Bund at various levels.", "So I got to be part of creating Laris, the fine dining restaurant I did there, and when I set out to do Laris, my ambition was to say that when you set foot in Laris it\u2019ll be like you\u2019ve been transported to a place that could anywhere in the world. And we achieved it, I think, and won awards that no one else has been able to win in this market, from an independent standpoint. And sadly it ran its course, and it\u2019s not so much that the restaurant ran out of life, it\u2019s more that the partnership did. So when I departed there I kind of took a break in terms of what I\u2019d do fine dining-wise, luxury-wise. Before leaving Three on the Bund I\u2019d started the company David Laris Creates, and we got involved with conceptualizing and developing outlets for people like Swire [Hotels], like the Opposite House in Beijing. ", "Later I noticed gaps in the market, so I did the Fat Olive. Then we opened up Downstairs [at the URBN Hotel] and the Purple Onion. Everything just fell into place, and that led to [the Fat Olive at Sinan Mansions] and 12 Chairs. So I went from having one of the largest fine dining restaurants in the country to one of the smallest (laughs). And it\u2019s given me the opportunity to refocus from the creative chef side, really where I want to position myself again and redevelop new menus and so on, and that\u2019s all with the plan that we\u2019re looking for a new location to do another Laris, maybe 60 seats, 70 seats. ", "What\u2019s been really interesting is we\u2019ve been getting a lot of Shanghainese who were following what I was doing at Laris, who are saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to [the Fat Olive] because we know you\u2019re here,\u201d and we\u2019re doing around two and a half thousand [yuan] average check, which is pretty good, by Shanghai standards.", "\u00a0", "The interior of David Laris\u2019s Yucca Lounge", "JD: Talking about gaps in the market, your restaurants here are pretty diverse in terms of focus. Are you just following your muse, or what is it that makes you say, I want to open this kind of restaurant or that kind of restaurant?", "DL: It\u2019s a combination of a few things, I think partly I do follow my muse. I feel like I want to do something, like I want to do cool, funky Greek food, or maybe someone\u2019s doing something similar and I\u2019ll say, \u201cI wanna create my version.\u201d There\u2019s that component of it. But other times it\u2019s based on the space. Then there\u2019s the strategic side, where it\u2019s strategically part of my brand and my DNA. I want to be cooking as a chef at the highest level that I can, so that\u2019s why we\u2019ll create something like 12 Chairs. The other stuff is really run by other passions, never by the numbers completely. Other people do that, but I wanna have a combination of, yes, it has to make money, but I want to find things that enrich the environment from a hospitality standpoint. When I originally got here, product-wise and industry-wise there was almost nothing here, there wasn\u2019t even that competition you have between chefs when a city starts to mature. We have that now between chefs and restaurateurs \u2014 it even gets a bit bitchy sometimes \u2014 but I think that\u2019s what a healthy industry needs to have, that push and pull, that energy. ", "I wanted to be part of shaping that industry, at least in my area, being more on the Western side, with a certain approach and intelligence in the way we look at hospitality and service and integrity and food. Deep down I hate to be boxed in, you know, I don\u2019t want to be defined as \u201cthe fine dining guy,\u201d and I think sometimes that\u2019s worked against me, because people say, \u201chow can you do Laris, and then do this Fat Olive thing?\u201d But in other parts of the world, chefs are doing it. It\u2019s just that it hasn\u2019t be done here, and everybody, particularly in Asia, loves to put people in categories, it just makes it easy.", "JD: Like \u201cWestern\u201d food.", "DL: (laughs) Or fusion, just because they put some coriander in it. So I wanted to constantly be a part of challenging those norms. And honestly, you feel [Shanghai] change. I mean, that\u2019s the great thing about China. You can feel it change in front of you. If you stay focused and determined on what\u2019s in front of you, you may get a little crap sometimes and people wanna have a bit of a go or whatever, but if you stick to it and there\u2019s real integrity, it\u2019ll stick, and then you see it start to mature, and out of this eight, nine years, it\u2019s been quite cool to watch it and then watch other people rise as well.", "JD: I\u2019m curious about that evolution of the actual market, because your main focus has been in Shanghai, so being so close on the ground here, what would you say has been the biggest change here in terms of diners, also in terms of competition?", "DL: Honestly, competition has gone from almost nothing, to actually, I would say now, to very serious competition coming. And I\u2019m excited by competition, on all levels, whether it be the high-end fine dining \u2014 it\u2019s great, because it elevates the city to a standard where we can be proud we\u2019re competing, and anytime we can compete globally it\u2019s exciting for us \u2014 but it\u2019s not just on that level we\u2019ve seen it mature, because it hasn\u2019t fully matured on that high-end yet. There\u2019s a lot of people doing fine dining, or high-end and it just doesn\u2019t have the integrity and discipline that it takes to make it to that level. But on the mid-range market, I think we\u2019re seeing a tremendous amount of great products popping up, people who are doing well-conceived, good designs that could fit into any major city in the world. We\u2019ve seen a lot more healthy competition, especially across the Mediterranean-French genre, and there\u2019s a lot of other great things like Baker & Spice. It\u2019s great to see this level of intelligence creeping in, and we\u2019re getting more access to products, so I can only say that the landscape is so different. There was nothing, and now there\u2019s loads.", "The other trend that we see is the diner itself. Now that the diner has all this choice, here you can see it actually evolve. If we talk about the China market first, which is one that everyone finds really interesting, there\u2019s more and more middle class coming out to try the Western experience, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going out to dinner tonight, I\u2019m gonna try Greek, or Italian,\u201d whereas before they might\u2019ve said \u201cI\u2019m gonna try Western\u201d and just go to any generic western restaurant. I think the initial entry level a few years ago would\u2019ve been Pizza Hut, but now they\u2019re engaged with it the way it should be done. ", "One thing I\u2019ve never believed in doing is dumbing it down for the local market. I think that\u2019s, at its core, distasteful to me.\u00a0If\u00a0you\u2019re talking about doing an Italian concept, do an Italian concept. If you want to do a Spanish concept, have the ib\u00e9rico hams, have the real deal, because the market will gravitate towards it. I think the Chinese market is looking for personality, they like good design, they like good quality products and they\u2019re not afraid to spend up. And I\u2019ll always test that out, I\u2019ll put a great piece of beef on the menu and it\u2019ll sell. I\u2019ll put on a whole snapper and it\u2019ll sell, because the perception and the fact is that it\u2019s good. So we\u2019ve seen more willingness to spend in the western market. And there\u2019s a few more things happening on the periphery, where there\u2019s a real interest in reading and learning about wine pairing and wine tasting, so that\u2019s only helping us. So in my restaurants I\u2019m seeing an ever-increasing number of Chinese middle-class and upper-middle class eating at my restaurants and knowing who I am and what my brand is.", "JD: How about on the Westerner side?", "DL: On the western side, that kind of big-budget, expat on expense thing isn\u2019t quite what it was. I think the recession kinda snapped everything back into reality. That profile of customer is still here, perhaps, but we did see a sort of replacement with the upper-middle-class Chinese, who were there to step in and start appreciating fine dining. ", "One thing I do comment on often is that the market isn\u2019t as mature as people like to make out, in terms of hospitality. It\u2019s still a hard gig. The anticipated demand for the F&B industry and the level of high-end in particular that\u2019s here is not equal to the amount of spending power that\u2019s required to sustain all of those\u00a0products. Another reason I\u2019m being cautious before I open the next massive fine dining\u00a0restaurant\u00a0is because I want to see how it settles down this year in particular. I\u2019d rather do a series of smaller things and be able to control them. Because if you look at the Hong Kong market, for example, and you look at the average spending you can get on wine and food for a Hong Kong restaurant, in Shanghai the rentals and staff costs we\u2019re paying have gone up quite a lot in the last 10 years, but we haven\u2019t hit the same numbers that someone may hit in a Hong Kong restaurant. When it catches up [in terms of spending] it\u2019s gonna be golden, but it\u2019s not there yet. Still, there\u2019s this perception that you can come here and kinda tap into the China market and instantly everyone\u2019s spending two thousand a head. But it isn\u2019t the reality.", "\u00a0", "Laris\u2019s newest (and smallest) restaurant, 12 Chairs", "JD: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unique to food and beverage at all, I think you see that in the luxury business as well.", "DL: True. The market isn\u2019t mature enough for all of those guys to do well, so they\u2019ve gotta be investing in long-term. And especially with luxury, the more boutique luxury [brands] have a harder time ahead of them, because the appreciation of more boutique luxury isn\u2019t quite here yet, If you go to Gucci in Beijing on a Sunday, it\u2019s like you\u2019re in Tesco\u2019s or something (laughs). But then you might go to a boutique luxury brand, which may be of better quality, yet it isn\u2019t as followed yet.", "JD: So I\u2019m a bit curious how that analogy works for your restaurants, because they do range in size, from larger to smaller. Now that you do have a personal brand here, what tends to be the \u2018entry-level\u2019 restaurant here that locals head to first?", "DL: They\u2019d probably come to something like Fat Olive or they\u2019d come for something like Downstairs. We find that seems to be something that\u2019s very much approachable and accessible, and I think they\u2019re the first ones for the larger market, let\u2019s say that. Purple Onion\u2019s a bit more boutique, and we\u2019ve only recently started to find an increase in Chinese customers, because it got a bit of a rap on Weibo. But it is so unique that I don\u2019t think the Chinese market could immediately put it into a category and go, \u201cis this what Mediterranean is supposed to be like?\u201d I think that\u2019s starting to change, as well. Definitely at the Fat Olive,\u00a0though, people will walk in and go, \u201cah, this is cool, I\u2019m comfortable here,\u201d and that\u2019s the very essence of capturing the Chinese market. ", "They have to walk in and feel, I get this, I can be here. Same with Downstairs \u2014 they get the food, they get the vibe, it\u2019s not pretentious, it\u2019s not trying to be. It\u2019s easily translated to Chinese and the staff are trained to kind of bring it to the people. So I find those two brands are the ones that jump up at the top.", "JD: Do you try to communicate to customers that there are other restaurants and suggest they try them?", "DL: Oh, sure. Subtly, and sometimes not so subtly (laughs). In our office, we make sure that when there are alignments that we\u2019re able to cross-pollinate. At the same time, I\u2019m a believer in keeping them all unique. I want each GM and each chef to feel like they\u2019re working with me in such a way that we are creating for them their environment and they take ownership of it. ", "But when we can do brand alignment across the entire group, hopefully whatever the concept is, if it\u2019s got an\u00a0umbrella\u00a0over it, [the key is] that it\u2019s at a certain level in terms of quality, food and service.", "Come back tomorrow for the second part of our exclusive interview with David Laris, covering his attention to detail and design, dealing with critics, and the Beijing vs. Shanghai culinary rivalry.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "How China\u2019s \u201cPrinceling\u201d Backlash Could Impact Its Luxury Market", "meta": "September 19, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Omega store on Shanghai\u2019s Nanjing Road.

This April, in a stated attempt to defuse social tensions about a widening wealth gap, Beijing was the first Chinese city to put the brakes on overly \u201cdecadent\u201d outdoor advertising, putting the kibosh on ads promoting (in the government\u2019s words) \u201chedonism, lavishness and the worship of foreign things.\u201d As Jing Daily noted at the time,\u00a0\u201cBeijing\u2019s new campaign should have little actual effect on the city\u2019s fast-growing luxury market\u2026[but] the ban shows that right now, in the words of\u00a0one article, \u201cluxury is a dirty word\u201d in Beijing.

In response to the Beijing ban, the last several months have seen some of the world\u2019s largest luxury brands focus their efforts in China far more on the digital side, making popular Chinese social media platforms like Sina Weibo, Jiepang, and Youku lynchpins of their marketing campaigns. Though young, these digital outreach efforts have shown signs of paying off, particularly among the highly coveted \u201cluxury newbie\u201d demographic of young Chinese white collar workers under the age of 35. According to L2\u2019s new China Digital IQ survey, Burberry, which has been perhaps the most aggressive apparel-focused luxury brand in terms of digital expansion in China, is one of only three brands to be ranked as digital \u201cgeniuses,\u201d owing to its innovative use of Jiepang and Youku to complement its broader brick-and-mortar expansion efforts.", "Still, Beijing\u2019s \u201chedonism\u201d ban and the digitalization of luxury marketing in China aren\u2019t the only reasons the decline of conspicuous consumption may speed up in coming years. Recently, a number of scandals have broken on the Chinese blogosphere via microblogging platforms like Sina Weibo, reflecting widespread anger among netizens about issues like corruption and the wealth gap. Controversies such as this summer\u2019s Guo Meimei flameup \u2014 in which Chinese netizens pilloried a young women who flaunted her apparent wealth on Sina Weibo \u2014 reflected the touchy situation for the world\u2019s top luxury brands in China, as public fury about Guo\u2019s desperate attempts at fame spilled scorn on Maserati, Hermes and other brands. Though Hermes may (according to an\u00a0unverified\u00a0study by Beijing\u2019s World Luxury Association) have seen a sales bump in China in the wake of the Guo Meimei scandal, the question does come up: At what cost?", "Luckily for labels that specialize in apparel and accessories, the greatest backlash in China has been reserved for automakers.

While some super-rich mainland Chinese will continue to shop locally regardless of price increases (whether out of convenience, \u201cface\u201d or because they simply don\u2019t care), consumers who shop around, or head in groups to duty-free Hong Kong once or twice a year to load up on luxury goods, probably won\u2019t change their behavior even if luxury taxes are cut.

Within the last year, possibly emboldened by the views LV\u2019s videos were getting, other brands like\u00a0Guerlain, Cartier and Longines launched their own channels, and in the first half of this year, Burberry streamed a live webcast of its Milan Fashion Show on Youku, helping its official channel reach over one million views.

The \u201coverlap\u201d in the luxury consumer base and the user demographics of video sites like Youku, which are similarly youthful, means they\u2019re a marketing tool that\u2019s difficult to ignore. As Youku SVP, Frank Ming Wei, added, increasing their presence on video sites like Youku is a good strategy for luxury brands to reach consumers in more far-flung interior regions.

The curious question, however, is whether these efforts are actually paying off in terms of sales. While LV\u2019s tie-up with Jiepang was by most accounts a success, this success was partly due to the fact that many\u00a0Jiepang users simply wanted to display the free virtual LV badge on their profiles. This, of course, is something of a marketing success but if it doesn\u2019t influence actual sales, it\u2019s essentially a fun little gimmick. That said, it\u2019s a very important space to watch, and if brands start to use Jiepang or other services to offer special promotions, we could theoretically see a significant sales bump.", "Now, as more brands launch exclusive channels on video sites like Youku and go beyond simply posting in-video advertisements, we still have several questions: How will brands best use this platform to actually entice viewers to buy?

We talk to our design team and tell them that if we want to be internationalised we need to do something very simple, sexy, the look has to fit Western tastes. Western people still like Western design.", "BoF: What about the Chinese customer? When they come to Shiatzy Chen, what are they looking for?", "HW: In Taiwan and China, they buy mostly the embroidered pieces. They feel, in terms of the craftsmanship and design, that Shiatzy Chen is very good; probably one of the best, and definitely comparable to the Western brands. They feel proud to wear our designs because we produce a very limited number of the same item. For instance, the jacket you just saw, we produced roughly one hundred pieces across four sizes.

For example Ports 1961 makes money.

With the ensuing increase in the number of wealthy residents, major luxury brands have begun to stream in, and the city now boasts two Louis Vuitton boutiques, a Gucci store, and brands like Tiffany & Co., Bally and Zegna concentrated at the high-end Charter Shopping Center (\u5353\u5c55\u8d2d\u7269\u4e2d\u5fc3). But interestingly enough, one factor that sets Shenyang apart from other fast-growing second-tier cities is its increasingly sophisticated second-hand luxury market. With Shenyang surpassing Hangzhou last year to become the third largest single luxury market in China with sales\u00a0totaling\u00a01.5 billion yuan (US$229 million), putting it behind only Beijing and Shanghai, a flood of high-end goods have washed over the city.

The event ultimately pulled in 240,000 yuan (US$37,000). Explained manager Mr. Liu, Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market has a great deal of potential. One month earlier, a similar event made more than 100,000 yuan, but this comparatively large event was not only a financial success but also proved extremely popular among Shenyang shoppers.", "Last December, after noting the potential for the future development of Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market, manager Liu decided to start a consignment business.

Far and away, the most popular items are women\u2019s handbags. The consumer base is predominantly female, with Liu saying that female shoppers comprise more than 70 percent of shoppers at his store. Most of Liu\u2019s customers are independent business owners, housewives, or white collar workers between the ages of 30-40. As most of these individuals socialize with a similarly high-income, luxury-obsessed crowd, Liu sees no shortage of potential demand for second-hand goods.", "The Sina article goes on to note that the rapid development of Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market may boil down to the fact that some of the top luxury brands and most popular handbags are extremely hard to come by in Shenyang, with people there often having to sign up on long\u00a0wait-lists\u00a0for Hermes bags in other cities. Currently, there are more than 20 high-end consignment shops in Shenyang, most of which are centered in the city\u2019s Huanggu (\u7687\u59d1), Xitie (\u94c1\u897f) and\u00a0Hunnan (\u6d51\u5357) neighborhoods, or near the Charter Shopping Center.

According to manager Liu\u2019s rough estimate, last year Shenyang\u2019s 20 second-hand luxury shops saw turnover of more than 10 million yuan (US$1.5 million), making it, in Liu\u2019s estimation, the undisputed second-hand luxury hub of northeastern China.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Chinese Media: Luxury Goods In China Up To 50% More Expensive Than Overseas", "meta": "March 31, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Hisense Plaza in Qingdao", "It\u2019s no secret that the high price of luxury goods in mainland China relative to Hong Kong, Europe or North America is a key factor driving Chinese consumers to buy these items abroad (or ask traveling friends to bring them back), shop at second-hand shops, or look for deals\u00a0online via overseas vendors.

It all depends on her target consumer. Currently, the DVF brand lacks the widespread brand awareness or appeal of a Louis Vuitton or Gucci in second- and third-tier cities, many of which are still in the first stage of international brand consumption. Given the choice between a DVF handbag and a more recognizable Chanel handbag, most well-heeled Chinese consumers beyond the ultra-brand-savvy in top-tier cities would choose the latter.

Rising from 4.5 million outbound departures in 1995 to over 57 million in 2010, it\u2019s not surprising that countries like the UK, US and South Korea are more actively courting Chinese tourists, with Britain in particular seeing a boost to its tourism industry from the so-called \u201cPeking Pound.\u201d While international destinations (and retailers) expect more Chinese tourists in their near future, China too is seeing increased domestic tourism,\u00a0particularly\u00a0among those of more modest means, particularly at popular spots like the Xixi wetlands and Sichuan\u2019s Jiuzhaigou.", "According to the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s latest report, the spending power of these tens of millions of mainland Chinese tourists should see them become the world\u2019s second-largest tourist contingent, surpassing the Japanese, as soon as 2013.

Abroad, many wealthier travelers told BCG that few hotels offered them special services, and that high-priced travel packages were lacking in personalization and interest.", "Aside from the takeaway that Chinese tourists are a rapidly growing, high-spending contingent, what can we learn from this report? For one, Chinese tourists are becoming more particular \u2014 both domestically and internationally. Wealthier individuals demand better service and put more focus on accommodations than in previous years, and expect more for their money. For another thing, multinational hotels can\u2019t simply expect to dump a new location anywhere in China and think it\u2019ll build the brand there. Bad service in China \u2014 which, according to this report, is endemic \u2014 will make Chinese tourists reluctant to stay at a given hotel when traveling overseas as well.", "Finally, dissatisfaction among Chinese tourists should be viewed as an opportunity for anyone in the tourism industry to re-evaluate how they plan to accommodate more Chinese tourists, particularly as they outnumber the formerly dominant Japanese. Hotels printed Japanese-language\u00a0menus and stores posted Japanese-language signage in the 1980s to make these valued tourists feel more at home. Why shouldn\u2019t the same be extended to Chinese tourists?

They pursue a higher quality of life and look to reflect their personal tastes through luxury consumption.", "But since the early days of China\u2019s \u201creform and opening up,\u201d a large number of nouveau riche and bigwigs were born. Early on, these nouveau riche were commonly seen wearing what were referred to at the time as \u201cdog chains\u201d \u2014 thick ropes of gold around their neck \u2014 and loudly boasting into mobile phones. (Rare in those days.) Soon, these people began to buy luxury cars and mansions, traveling overseas to buy luxury goods, and eventually taking part in tour groups focused solely on buying luxury goods in Europe, sweeping through stores and leaving people dumbstruck. A good example [of conspicuous consumption in China] is how Louis Vuitton has recently sought to cultivate a more low-key image with its latest collections, yet at stores in mainland China the company must continue to stock old models that prominently display the LV logo, or else they know they won\u2019t sell any bags.", "In China, many people live frugally for months to buy an LV key chain, a pair of Chanel sunglasses or a Prada wallet. I heard a joke once about a girl sitting on a bus was carrying an LV bag that was ripped apart by a robber, who was looking to steal the mobile phone and 1,000 yuan she was carrying. As the man ran away, leaving the girl with a destroyed LV bag, she screamed, \u201cIf you wanted the money you should\u2019ve just said something. Why\u2019d you have to destroy my bag?\u201d. Recently, \u201cFashion\u201d magazine referred to the kind of bag-obsessed young woman you see in China nowadays as a \u201cMadame Bovary\u201d \u2014 her income is too low to afford luxury handbags, but through buying relatively inexpensive accessories she can feel like she\u2019s a part of the upper class. This kind of consumer actually makes up a pretty high proportion of the luxury goods consumer market in China.", "The other kind of Chinese luxury consumer focuses on \u201ccompetition through consumption,\u201d and a considerable amount of their consumption is geared towards doing business, meaning an item\u2019s social communication and packaging are more important to them. For them, the purchase of a luxury item is a way to stick a label on themselves, draw them into a certain social circle, and bring them opportunities. Another use of luxury purchases for this group is to give away as a high-end gift, since it\u2019s tacky to just give someone money. For example, LOTOS glasses [from Germany] are a hot commodity in China, and a considerable number of sales come from people who give pairs as gifts to government officials who have a yen for low-key luxury.", "From my point of view, luxury is innocent, and it has its uses. I don\u2019t have any objection to luxury, I just don\u2019t like the blind pursuit and blind worship of it [you often see in China].", "Someday, the attitude of Chinese people towards luxury consumption will stop being one of \u201cbuying luxury, buying status,\u201d and one that is gradually more mature. However, this will be a long process and take a lot of time and money. By that point, China will likely have its own international luxury brands.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Week In Review: February 28 \u2013 March 4", "meta": "March 4, 2011", "paragraphs": ["In case you missed them the first time around, here are some of Jing Daily\u2019s top posts for the week of February 28-March 4:", "No Logo", "Revisiting The Prospects For \u201cNo Logo\u201d Luxury In China", "Are wealthy Chinese shoppers starting to forego Louis Vuitton and Gucci for lesser-known, less ostentatious brands?

Though domestically grown grapes account for the majority of wine sold by the COFCO-owned Great Wall and its main competitors Dynasty and Changyu, the stated ambitions of these wineries (which make up more than 90 percent of the Chinese wine market) to move up the value chain and potentially into international markets has seen them scouring the world\u2019s best wine-growing regions looking for bargains.", "While the relative cheapness of land in places like Bordeaux or Chile is certainly a factor in the decision by Chinese companies to branch into uncertain lands, there are two arguably more important selling points: the quality of the land and the PR value.

But for upstart Chinese luxury brands, long accustomed to, but never comfortable with, playing second fiddle to dominant foreign competitors like Louis Vuitton or Gucci, the market is even more difficult. While industry figures like Zhao Yunhu of Shenzhen Copais, Zhang Zhifeng of NE-TIGER, and Jiang Qiong\u2019er of Shang Xia are confident that Chinese designers will be able to call on their civilization\u2019s culture and long history of craftsmanship to create truly global brands that can compete both at home and abroad, so far Chinese consumers themselves have proven to be more fixated on Western imports.", "So when \u2014 if ever \u2014 will Chinese brands really hit the world stage? What will they have to do to not only sell in Europe or North America, but, perhaps more importantly, in their home market? This week, Shanghai\u2019s BundPic (\u5916\u6ee9\u753b\u62a5) speaks to Christian Blanckaert, former Executive Vice President of Hermes International, about Chinese consumption and the possibility that we might see a home-grown Chinese brand make a splash in Paris, New York or Milan. From the interview (translation by Jing Daily team):", "BundPic (B): How do Western academics view China\u2019s sudden obsession with luxury goods?", "Christian Blanckaert (CB): I\u2019ll tell you a story. I first came to China in 1979 on an official visit. I went to Chengdu, which at that time only had one hotel that would accommodate foreigners. They told me not to go out at night, but I snuck out anyway, to g0 take a walk. As I came to a park, I encountered a large group of young Chinese. Just like today, at that time I couldn\u2019t speak a word of Chinese, but there were some people there who could actually speak French. They were listening to an international French radio program, learning the language. And we spoke throughout the night.", "Those young men said to me: you have highways, your cars are so beautiful, and so are your watches and ties. Eventually, I gave my watch and tie to them. At that time, the Chinese people had virtually nothing, but they had dreams, and I said if China opened its doors, these people would be able to make their dreams come true. So, in my opinion, a long history, a cultural break from the past and a new kind of freedom all combined to create the obsession with luxury goods we currently see in China.", "B: Among the innumerable local brands in China, do you think any can emerge as a true world-class luxury brand?", "CB: This is a question of considerable interest to me. Some European and American scholars believe that real luxury is only likely to come from the West. But another viewpoint is that the dominant luxury brands today are simply a step ahead, and that we\u2019ll see new luxury brands emerging in the future. I agree with the latter viewpoint.", "But I have to emphasize that a luxury brand must first be recognized in its own country \u2014 this is a critical point. Before hitting the world stage, Louis Vuitton built an outstanding reputation in Paris, and Gucci did the same in Florence. If a Chinese brand wants to capture the hearts of Europeans, it should first be successful in Beijing, Harbin, and Shenzhen. I think China already has the conditions needed for the development of world-class brands, but entrepreneurs need to have patience, because it\u2019ll even take quite a bit of time to become successful in China.\u00a0Chinese people always seem to be overly anxious. They often don\u2019t know that it takes an extraordinary amount of time to create a good brand.", "B: How long do you think it\u2019ll take for this kind of brand to emerge in China?", "CB: At least 20 years. But this all hinges on whether there are already some far-sighted people in China who are willing to devote the time to accomplish this. If so, we\u2019ll see the results in 20 years. However, this will be a very difficult process, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done: they have to determine their objectives, build a good design team, they need to have a story to\u00a0tell. The reason Yves Saint Laurent was able to build a brand from nothing was because he had a very clear idea in his mind what look he wanted to create for women. So the brand founder must be clear! The brand needs to have substance, in order to avoid over-reliance on marketing, and let the clothes speak for themselves.", " ", "Christian Blanckaert (Image: PR)", "B: In your imagination, what would a Chinese brand be like?", "CB: In my mind, the perfect Chinese luxury brand would be like calligraphy \u2014 a kind of pure perfection, kind of Zen. The pursuit of quality should be of primary importance. Ancient Chinese lacquer-ware and ceramics were once very inspiring to [the Western world], but a more modern Chinese style needs to capture the hearts of the Chinese people themselves.", "B: It takes world-class production abilities to create world-class luxury goods. Isn\u2019t the standard of \u201cMade in China\u201d high enough already?", "CB: Frankly, the reputation of \u201cMade in China\u201d goods around the world is not good. If the best-known brands mark their products with a \u201cMade in China\u201d label, they may even damage their brand image, and even the Chinese people think things are made better in France. This is the situation today, but this can change in the future. Before anything,\u00a0Chinese brands need to show that they can produce beautiful handcrafted items, such as silk or cashmere products, in order to let the market see that they are capable of world-class quality.", "In my view, the establishment of domestic Chinese luxury brands will initially be based on a process of cooperation, combining the design expertise of Europe, the production capabilities of China, and the pursuit of Japanese quality. If the strengths of these areas can be interwoven, it\u2019s quite a feasible idea.", "B: Another option is the acquisition of established European brands. Recently, media reported a Chinese businessman was trying to purchase a majority share of Prada yet was immediately refused by the board. What do you think about this?", "CB: The participation of the Chinese [in the European luxury market] terrifies Europeans. I am on the board of directors of an Italian brand, and I often hear people there say things like, \u201cWe\u2019re afraid of the Chinese! China is too big, and if so many Chinese enter the capital markets, what kind of scene would it create?\u201d The Chinese people that these Europeans come into contact with are typically trade delegations. They line up dozens of people to negotiate business investments, who all say they want to buy such-and-such amount of shares, want to get such-and-such returns. This is, indeed, very intimidating.", "Many luxury brands are actually small-scale family operations, and for those who don\u2019t know anything about the Chinese, they\u2019d be far more likely to better understand the Italian style of cooperation. I hope, in the future, that the Chinese learn to pay more attention to their communication style, sending only two or three people at a time who can connect on a personal level, maybe tell [the potential European partner] that they also love art, that they want to build whatever type of brand together. Don\u2019t always talk about money, as this will only create distance."]}, {"title": "Few Surprises In Bain & Co\u2019s Latest China Luxury Market Study", "meta": "November 10, 2010", "paragraphs": ["Dior has made a strong push in the Shanghai market this year, with the city providing the backdrop for David Lynch's \"Lady Blue Shanghai\" short film", "This week, Bain & Co. released its newest China Luxury Market Study.

Also predictable is the finding that Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci remained the \u201cmost desirable\u201d luxury brands in China this year.", "Prada, Versace, Burberry, Zegna and Armani entered or improved their rankings in Bain\u2019s list of top three brands \u201clikely to be purchased\u201d among consumers this year, although much of this is likely due to the increasing number of boutiques these brands have opened this year. Also similar to last year\u2019s findings is the figure that the vast majority (67%) of growth this year will have come from new customers.", "This indicates two things: that China is supply-driven (which, again, calls back to the speed of brand expansion), and consumer loyalty is low. This isn\u2019t terribly surprising, considering consumer sophistication in top-tier cities is apparently outpacing brand outreach, and as more newly wealthy consumers load up on brands like LV and Gucci, \u201cearly adopters\u201d are likely to move on to less \u201cmass market\u201d luxury brands. (Previously on Jing Daily)", "The really interesting trends that Bain identified in its new study are the increase in domestic shopping, the growing importance of the Internet as a source of luxury product information, and localized brand-building. Other trends, including the key position that \u201cgifting\u201d plays in the China luxury market, consumer demand for better service, and the importance of second- and third-tier cities have been covered well by Jing Daily and other China-focused outlets regularly over the past 11 months.", "As Bain notes, the increase in domestic spending (as opposed to shopping in Hong Kong or overseas) has been a key trend this year. Although domestic shopping still makes up less than 50% of luxury spending among Chinese consumers (44%, to be exact), the study notes that this is changing as more brands have focused on providing latest collections in the mainland market, including lower-ticket items in mainland inventories, and reducing operating margins to offset the tax difference. Going on, Bain identifies five main reasons Chinese shoppers will choose to shop locally rather than overseas: a desire to be perceived as a \u201cVIP,\u201d a better shopping experience, better size availability, access to service after sales, and impulse. As expected, the two main reasons Chinese shoppers will purchase luxury items overseas remain lower prices and a broader product selection.", "Another interesting finding is the growing importance of the Internet as an information source. Bain found that 60% of potential shoppers get their information about luxury goods online \u2014 up from only around 25% in 2006 \u2014 which makes the Internet the second most popular source of information after magazines (72%). We\u2019ve seen a much more focused effort by several digitally savvy brands to invest in online outreach in China, although some have been far more successful than others.", "The third interesting trend, one that we\u2019ve watched closely this year, is that of localization at the city level.

Additionally, brands have focused more on local CSR (corporate social responsibility) efforts this year, with potential shoppers responding positively to events like Cartier\u2019s \u201cSinging Song for You\u201d project, Hermes\u2019 \u201cBeichuan Rose Vally \u2013 Hermes Rose Garden,\u201d and Gucci\u2019s \u201cNew Vision, New Hope\u201d event.", "Download the entire Bain & Co study here (PDF)."]}, {"title": "Event Watch: Luxury Brands Conference in Shanghai (Nov 8-10)", "meta": "November 8, 2010", "paragraphs": ["The event takes place at the new Ritz-Carlton Pudong (Photo: PR)", "Organized by business events and summit planners Marcus Evans, the Luxury Brands Conference (November 8-10) at the Ritz-Carlton Pudong in Shanghai is not to be missed.

Lose the Logos \u2013 As China becomes the undeniable focal point for the international luxury industry, Chinese will also rapidly become more sophisticated consumers of brands.\u00a0 They will shed the most obvious signs of status slavery and gain a deeper understanding of the quality that brands represent.\u00a0 There will be less buying of a brand merely to become part of a group and more purchases made to show one\u2019s own taste or individuality.", "2. Inspiration from Within \u2013 The rise of the internet, fashion blogs, street style pictures, and a greater general confidence means that inspiration might start to come more from the young people on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai and less from celebrities, western magazines, and Tokyo and Seoul. Those interested in style \u2013 into their thirties \u2013 might look to the post \u201880 generation for determining what is cool in areas well beyond just dressing.", "3. Spending Abroad \u2013 Chinese are already the biggest spenders on luxury goods \u2013 per visitor \u2013 in Paris and other locations.\u00a0 Their pursuit of lower prices and greater selection abroad will be a sort of \u201cChinese Remedy\u201d to the recession, at least in some parts of the economy.", "4. Better Selection at Home \u2013 Availability of luxury products in China has always lagged behind the perceived importance of the market.\u00a0 Soon, more brands will open their most dazzling flagships and the latest pop-up boutiques in Shanghai and Beijing.\u00a0 There will be more products tailored for the Chinese market and their will be less slighting of Chinese consumers \u2013 full product lines will arrive here and they will not feature products from seasons before.", "5. Chinese Fashion Designers \u2013 Most of them will be considered derivative, low-quality, and not worthy of notice.\u00a0 However, the sheer number of young people studying fashion design and the number starting up fashion brands guarantees that more will gain greater acceptance both locally and abroad.", "6. Art Market Blossoms Again \u2013 This might be largely on the backs of Chinese spending and thus the focus could be less on contemporary art and more on the old masters.\u00a0 In the end of 2009, we already saw signs of this with the sale of \u201cEighteen Arhats\u201d by Ming Dynasty painter Wu Bin for RMB 170 Million at auction.", "7. Emissions Cutting \u2013 Among an elite group of urban hipsters, there may be efforts made to live a more carbon-neutral life through buying secondhand, riding a bike, or eating less meat.\u00a0 This is likely to stay quite limited at first.", "8.Charity Goes Mainstream \u2013 In every part of life, charity and giving will become rapidly more obvious.\u00a0 Events, brands, and all spending will increasingly have to have charity focus.\u00a0 Charity will become one of the main subjects of conversation and it will start to be a loss of face for anyone with any money not to be giving. A concern \u2013 and excuse for not giving \u2013 will remain the uncertainty with respect to how said money is used [by the charities].", "9. Buddhism \u2013 This will be another big topic of conversation for the wealthy and others. It will be increasingly acceptable and even expected in some circles for people to express devotion to Buddhism and causes related to it.", "10. Sanya \u2013 Vacationing will continue to blossom and [the Hainan province resort city of] Sanya will be the major focus.\u00a0 At this point much of the spending there is in the form of gifts to government officials or business partners, but affluent families will increasingly take their own \u2013 self-funded \u2013 vacations there.", "Nels Frye is the Editor-in-Chief of LifeStyle Magazine, China\u2019s leading bilingual publication focusing on architecture, inner space, decor, luxury goods, travel, and other LifeStyle subjects.

Now as more women are becoming economically independent, they account for a larger share of the luxury market and there is a big potential.\u201d However, while the balance is undoubtedly shifting, men are likely to continue to exercise the dominant influence in this sphere for some time to come.

Moreover, media buyers in China prefer to spend your money where it benefits preexisting relationships of theirs, or where they can get preferential treatment such as rebates.", "Brand managers need to push their media buyers to embrace digital marketing more strongly. They also need to work with marketing agencies that have strong in-house digital capabilities.", "Chinese consumers are buying more, but they are also getting more sophisticated and building higher expectations. Companies need to keep up with both their problems and their needs. Multinationals need to build on consumer trust in their international brands, and they need to look for ways to expand their sales through the right channels and connect with consumers through the right marketing plans. This will often mean creating an e-commerce platform and emphasizing social media and digital marketing as primary rather than secondary ways of connecting with customers.", "Consumer spending in China is increasing, but, just as important, it is also evolving. Every company selling products there needs to evolve, too.", "Rein\u2019s concluding point is the key, here. China\u2019s consumer class has emerged onto the scene and evolved at a breakneck pace. This is particularly noticeable in places like Beijing, where the more sophisticated (or relatively long-time) luxury demographic has, over the course of the last 10 years or so, gone from worshipping the biggest names, like Louis Vuitton and Gucci, to branching out into less monolithic, more exclusive\u00a0brands like Goyard and\u00a0Azzedine Ala\u00efa (though it must be said that part of this comes down to\u00a0greater choice in places like Beijing now, since major department stores \u2014 which carry more hard-to-find brands \u2014 like Lane Crawford have opened in China\u2019s capital in recent years).

By tailoring messages to target demographics and to a given medium or platform \u2014 e.g., white-collar social media sites like Kaixin \u2014 brands like Tiffany & Co. have, over the last year, been able to give potential customers the feeling of exclusivity that traditional marketing simply can\u2019t instill.

While these brands and the many others that dot China\u2019s urban centers have yet to make their mark overseas, and have\u00a0yet to fully crack the still-Euro-obsessed Chinese luxury consumer market, over time as consumers in major metropolitan areas start to take foreign brands for granted and look to differentiate themselves by mixing and matching Asian and Western styles, Chinese luxury brands should be well placed to capitalize.", "The idea of home-grown luxury development in China is important to luxury marketers all over the world, from those in the country who want to build their brands now so they can cash in later, to European and American luxury execs who want to ensure their brands keep the prestige that has made them so successful in China over the last 20 years.
