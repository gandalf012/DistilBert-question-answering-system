Now we are ready to take this vision outside of London in new and exciting ways. Doing a show in China is a first for me. It\u2019s a country that has always been so supportive of me and the moment will be a culmination of everything the teams and I have been working towards since I first started. It will be a celebration of our collections and our new attitude in one of the most innovative and inspiring cities in the world.\u201d", "Burberry currently has 61 stores in China and is set to open a social retail store in Shenzhen Bay as part of an\u00a0exclusive partnership with Tencent\u00a0during the first half of 2020. Previously, Burberry hosted a holographic show in 2011 for the opening of its Beijing flagship store and another catwalk in 2014 for the opening of the Shanghai Kerry Center. Nonetheless, this is the first time the brand has chosen to show a full collection in China and with new looks created entirely with Chinese consumers in mind.", "According to the brand,\u00a0driving engagement and inspiring luxury consumers in China is a key focus for Burberry in 2020.\u00a0November 2019 saw\u00a0Burberry report\u00a0strong H1 results, despite continued unrest in Hong Kong shaking profits in the region. In mainland China, sales grew by a \u201cmid-teen percentage\u201d with the brand continuing to localize its China communications.", "In line with this, Burberry began the year with a dedicated Lunar New Year campaign and limited-edition capsule supported by a new online game in honor of the Year of the Rat.

We want to continually inspire our customers. The show is the latest in a series of exciting events we have planned this year in China, one of our most important markets, as we set out on the next phase of our transformation.\u201d", "Given that the Shanghai show will be certainly a star-studded event, Burberry is hoping that that it will help increase its popularity amongst China\u2019s savvy, young consumers. Back in 2017, for example, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2018s first show in Shanghai saw seats selling on Taobao for $13,700 dollars a cushion.

Burberry, therefore, remains optimistic, expecting \u201can element of repatriation of tourist consumers into mainland China and Korea.\u201d", "And indeed, despite this significant headwind in Hong Kong, globally Burberry\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 11 percent to \u00a3193 million for the six months to September, while revenue increased five percent to \u00a31.28 billion.

The first step of the partnership will be for Burberry to open its first \u201csocial retail store\u201d in Shenzhen, powered by Tencent technology. The store is expected to open in the first half of 2020, in the new MixC Shenzhen Bay development.\u00a0The store will offer unique experiences that connect luxury customers\u2019 social and online lives to their physical environments.

Continuing our history of innovation, we wanted to explore the connection between these touchpoints by merging social media and the store experience to reflect the way luxury customers are engaging with brands. China was the obvious place to start as it is one of the leading hubs for innovation and technology and Chinese consumers are some of the highest users of social media. We are thrilled to be partnering exclusively with Tencent on this pioneering project which is an example of the step-change in our ambitions for the next phase of our transformation.\u201d", "Burberry has noticeably been focusing its efforts on mainland China in recent months in an attempt to cushion the effects of Hong Kong\u2019s declining sales. At Riccardo Tisci\u2019s celebrated Spring/Summer 2020 show, the brand actively targeted the Chinese consumer by harnessing the power of its Chinese brand ambassadors, including singer Kun Chen, actress Dongyu Zhou, and rapper Lucas Huang.", "Despite exciting advances in mainland China, today\u2019s results suggest that political turmoil in Hong Kong creates an uncertain future for many luxury brands in the Asia Pacific region. Now, with Tencent in tow, Burberry will be looking to avoid the worst of the negative impact.", "Meanwhile, back in Hong Kong, and according to the brand, Burberry is currently pursuing rental renegotiations with landlords in the hopes of boosting profit margins and are switching focus to local clientele and pursuing local business.

Today, Zhang owns a \u201cThomas Burberry Monogram\u201d t-shirt (priced at $400), which happened to be the first item Tisci designed for the brand.

Burberry\u2019s TB handbag collection is gaining an increasing amount of attention from shoppers lately, according to Rita He, a veteran daigou agent who specializes in serving the country\u2019s upper-middle-class buyers. \u201cThe runway TB bags are in demand by my clients, for example, and lately, the canvas tote bags are also popular,\u201d He said. However, He was uncertain if TB bags could be considered as \u201cIt\u201d bags, \u201cbecause its desirability is still way behind some trending models including Louis Vuitton\u2019s trunk bag, Chanel\u2019s Gabrielle cross-body bag, and Dior\u2019s saddle bag.\u201d", "Aside from product innovation, Burberry also devotes a significant amount of resources to communicate its transformation. In China, the brand is experimenting with the \u201cdrop\u201d retail model on WeChat \u2014 learning from the commercial success of streetwear brands such as Supreme \u2014 to stir excitement and desirability. Burberry has also relocated and renovated some retail stores in major Chinese cities to ensure its store offerings are in line with the brand\u2019s new DNA.", "While Burberry seems to be on the right track to having a business turnaround, the question remains to be whether the current upward trend can be sustained in a tough business environment in which Brexit, the trade war, and the slowing Chinese economy are adding a various level of uncertainties.", "Citi Research, in an investor note published on July 12, described Burberry as a bag full of high hopes. \u201cWe think the company will deliver stronger growth in the second half of the year given improvement in new product availability.\u201d The brand plans to grow the offerings of Tisci\u2019s new collection out of total share to around 60 percent by September and around 75 percent by fiscal year-end 2020. JP Morgan, however, shows more caution than optimism quite simply because of its timing, \u201cThe cycle is becoming tougher and we have never seen turnarounds succeed in adverse cycles. Plus, Burberry is highly exposed to the Sterling volatility around Brexit.\u201d", "Even Burberry itself is cautious on the outlook. The pick-up of Q1 LFL sales did not give the brand enough confidence to lift its full-year projections.

The ruling was based on a February 2012 application challenging Burberry\u2019s rights to the trademark, and although the site didn\u2019t state who had filed the challenge, it is speculated that it came from Chinese retailer Polo Santa Roberta, which has been embroiled in legal battles with Burberry over the pattern for nine years.

Firstly, part of the reason for its strong China growth is the fact that it has only been in the China market since 2010. This means the brand is more novel amongst consumers and has not become overexposed, as many experts state has happened to Louis Vuitton, which has seen lackluster China sales in recent quarters. Being new to the market is generally an advantage, but it also means that it is imperative that the company must work to establish a sense of its brand DNA amongst consumers, especially those with rising incomes in lower-tier cities who are new to the luxury market.", "A flood of legal Haymarket Check products may confuse customers, dilute the brand\u2019s image, and lead to overexposure before it can even become fully established.

If Burberry loses the right to its signature tartan, it could take no such measure.", "This may sound like a grave situation for Burberry if it isn\u2019t able to win in its upcoming battle. However, the challenges are likely not insurmountable for several reasons. First of all, the trademark only relates to leather goods, not the brand\u2019s signature checked scarves and trench linings. In addition, fake products are already ubiquitous in China, including those bearing Burberry\u2019s pattern. The Chinese government hasn\u2019t been doing much to cut down on them even with the rights to the trademark, yet Burberry\u2019s sales have still been growing at a significant rate in the country.", "More importantly, this challenge comes at a time when Chinese consumers continue to become more focused on quality and heritage, and less on outward displays of wealth like logos, or in the case of Burberry, patterns. From Burberry\u2019s recent marketing efforts, it looks like the company has already taken note of this, focusing on promoting its \u201cArt of the Trench\u201d campaign to highlight the craftsmanship and design of its classic coat. In addition, losing its rights in China doesn\u2019t affect its goods outside the mainland, where Chinese luxury consumers do 60 percent of their luxury shopping. Buying guaranteed authentic Burberry products in London is likely to still hold a certain cachet that brands in China won\u2019t be able to take away for the near future just from using the checked pattern.", "With issues like rampant fakes being sold both online and off, trademark trolls, and China\u2019s confusing intellectual property laws, the foreign luxury market certainly faces challenges in the country.

In recent years, the carbon footprint \u2014 in particular of shows and fashion weeks \u2014 has been called out by the industry.

Bel Jacobs, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion Fashion Action, explains: \u201cAccording to a recent report, the travel undertaken by buyers and brands resulted in about 241,000 of CO2 emissions a year so any attempt by any fashion week to go digital would of course be welcome.\u201d\u00a0", "As the Shanghai platform emerges in global importance, it represents the most powerful consumer base and production center in the world. \u201cIf the organizers [of Shanghai Fashion Week] were to embrace the digital format, rather than fly fashion editors in from every corner of the globe, the significance would be enormous.

These local fashion conglomerates have steadily transformed domestic fashion on the mainland, but independent designers are truly raising the industry\u2019s profile and reputation globally. In cases where corporations like Alibaba and JD.com have provided a platform for the smaller designers, the impact is only raised.

Given this, it\u2019s not surprising to find that the vast majority of Chinese consumers\u2019 daily lives has become intertwined with social media. Now, however, a transformation from social platforms to consumption models throughout the domestic market is becoming more and more diverse and seamless. The concept of Social Retail, which revolves around rewarding consumers for what they share online, has already penetrated close to 71% percent of the country. Last November, for example, Burberry announced a partnership with China\u2019s domestic tech powerhouse Tencent to develop a Social Retail program throughout the mainland. The alliance indicates that luxury players are embracing Social Retail to adapt to China\u2019s social ecology that shapes consumer behaviors.", "At the beginning of this year, the Boston Consulting Group and Tencent jointly published a whitepaper, \u201c2020 China Social Retail Playbook,\u201d to help brands and companies better understand the landscape of Social Retail in China. This playbook navigates the dynamics of Social Retail, the current trends and practices of the leading players, and highlights the strategic transformation that brands can leverage in the social media era.", "Here, Jing Daily recaps four key takeaways from the whitepaper that speak to fashion, beauty, and luxury industries. They are:", "The complicated social media matrix has disrupted the former step-by-step communication channels between brands and consumers. A touchpoint is any interaction that might interfere in how consumers feel about the products, service, and brands, while a channel is where the interaction happens, including mailings, paid media advertising, physical exposure, etc.", "According to the whitepaper, the number of the average touchpoints that alter consumer decision-making is 5.2 and 53% of them are social attributes, including social media like WeChat and Weibo, video-sharing platforms like Tiktok and Kuaishou, and social e-commerce such as Little Red Book.", "Brands need to create various touchpoints in different channels, especially before purchasing. As the core channel for managing long-term consumer relationships, social media plays a significant role before and after purchasing.", "A decentralized distribution system is replacing the traditional model \u2014 one in which brands make the decision what and how information is shared with consumers. Realizing the authority of conventional media has been diluted and consumers are being empowered by social media, brands are switching to meet consumers\u2019 inner motivations through various \u201csocial fission\u201d mechanisms, such as rewarding discounts after reposting a brands\u2019 post and engaging in Weibo Super Topics to drive online traffic for idols, and to encourage consumers to take the initiative to distribute information for the brand.", "The whitepaper indicates that 80% of respondents who are under 25 years old have actively shared or reposted product-related information. This percentage is also vigorous in the luxury fashion, and beauty industries, with 86% and 80% respectively, demonstrating strong engagement among luxury younger consumers.", "Given the high acquisition cost in driving traffic through traditional methods, encouraging consumers to voice a brands merits is the most efficient solution. Brands should identify potential groups that are willing to take the initiative and design corresponding systems and rules to trigger \u201csocial fission.\u201d", "Private domain traffic has been the buzzword of 2019 in China. In contrast to traditional, public domain traffic-driven platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, Baidu, Little Red Book, Taobao, etc., private domain traffic is fueled through private chats and group chats consisting of users who share similar interests or habits.", "This phenomenon has given birth to KOCs, or key opinion consumers, who recommend products and influence consumers like their close friends in company-organized WeChat groups. Other approaches of generating private domain traffic include inviting customers to follow WeChat or Weibo official accounts, where brands can share the latest product information and campaigns, guide customers to online stores, and most importantly, access user data across the ecosystem.", "The idea of private domain traffic derived from Taobao and WeChat store operations and has been implemented by global luxury brands. Through inviting customers to scan a QR code of an Official Account or a Mini Program, brands can continuously stay relevant to their customers after they leave their brick-and-mortar stores and websites, meaning that brands can maximize customer lifetime value \u2014 the total amount of money to be made from a customer.", "The days of big companies cornering a market through media advertising and exclusive control of sales channels has passed on. Now, brands under conglomerates must construct efficient organization structures that can respond to China\u2019s ever-shifting market.", "Today\u2019s consumers are no longer disciples of established brands, showing an inclusive attitude towards new brands, products, and experience. This revolution reminds big brands to innovate specific, fast-paced, and flexible strategies when communicating with digital-savvy Chinese consumers.", "Specificity suggests brands should assume diversified and specific scenarios to develop products and experiences for customers; fast pace means brands need to launch new products frequently instead of the typical two seasons per year; flexibility implies global players have to improve cultural sensitivity and further localization."]}, {"title": "Tencent Fuels $125 Million into Farfetch\u2019s China Growth", "meta": "January 30, 2020", "paragraphs": ["The Jing Take reports on a piece of the leading news and presents our editorial team\u2019s analysis of the key implications for the luxury industry.

Tencent\u2019s $125 million may not seem like a lot (it\u2019s only half the amount Farfetch paid to acquire online sneaker seller Stadium Goods), but let\u2019s think about the technology and network support Farfetch is able to get via Tencent. Plus, it might also be the first to test all WeChat features including the ones in Beta.", "This is also a win for Tencent, who has already dipped its toes in the world of luxury fashion through its partnership with Burberry to open a \u201csocial retail store\u201d in early 2020. Moreover, in 2017, China\u2019s internet giant JD.com has put almost $400 in Farfetch and now handles logistics for the company in China.

This is hardly surprising, as China currently accounts for more than 30 percent of all global luxury sales. This trend has been gaining momentum since the 2000s but has mushroomed over the last couple of years as more brand names venture into the Chinese market. Who can forget Fendi\u2019s iconic show on the Great Wall of China in 2007? This was followed by Herm\u00e8s\u2019 memorable show in Shanghai\u2019s World Financial Centre in 2008 and Armani\u2019s seminal One Night In Beijing show, which was watched by over 1,000 guests in 2012.", "While platforms like the Shanghai International Fashion Showcase \u2014 an event helmed by the man who made Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s Great Wall show a reality, Terence Chu \u2014 offer traditional venues where brands can present their collections during Shanghai Fashion Week, these days, many prefer to go it alone. The latest brand to announce it will show in China is British luxury giant Burberry, which will show its Fall 2020 collection in Shanghai on April 23. Last year, Valentino, Prada, and Dior all chose to produce solo runway shows in China, and even sportswear lines are making this leap (American brand Under Armour held an event at the Imperial Ancestral Temple of Beijing in 2017.)", "It\u2019s a trend that has firmly taken hold, regardless of the city, since these shows provide direct access to the world\u2019s largest fashion market (as an example, China now provides Valentino with roughly 30 percent of its global business). And while the spectacle and drama associated with these fashion shows have not waned, they\u2019re no longer staged as spectacles in their own right, rather they are strategically-produced attempts to earn shares of this valuable market.", "Thus, in this current landscape, stakeholder interests have shifted due to increased domestic luxury consumption. Government policies that encourage this shift in spending have left Western companies scrambling to find new and authentic ways to avoid sales losses. For many, this has meant refocusing on the Chinese market. To ensure names like Burberry remain relevant with existing Chinese fans as domestic competition heats up, it makes sense for fashion houses to showcase inside mainland China. And while potential rewards are enticing, there are also many pitfalls. Here, Jing Daily has taken a deep dive into what luxury brands can gain by staging runway shows in China and what can unfortunately backfire.", "Pros:", "Increased brand value among China\u2019s consumers", "Westen luxury groups are increasingly dependent on Chinese luxury consumers, so they must keep ahead of the competition and increase their brand\u2019s value or else face additional competition from local conglomerates and emerging designers. Jack Porteous, head of the retail and e-commerce sector at the China-Britain Business Council (CBBC), suggests the answer lies in dynamic content. \u201cIf companies can get the content right,\u201d he states, \u201cthen demonstrating to Chinese consumers that they are a valued part of the brand story and the brand\u2019s future development\u2026 will surely build a lasting connection and add brand value.\u201d", "However, content must be authentic enough to resonate memorably with consumers in a genuine way. If it\u2019s not, netizens will be quick to vent their objections online, as they\u2019ve done on numerous occasions. Most recently, it happened in retaliation to Dior\u2019s ill-advised playing of a classic Chinese patriotic song, \u201cMy Motherland and Me\u201d (\u201c\u6211\u548c\u6211\u7684\u7956\u56fd\u201d) after its Spring 2020 fashion show in Shanghai.", "Porteous argues that being on the ground in China offers increased market awareness, while hinting that these types of missteps might be avoided, saying, \u201c[being here] will help brands to grow an understanding of the market and [its] customers. Moreover, ensuring you have Chinese designers and creatives as part of your team is your best chance of making sure you get it right and can develop a true understanding of Chinese heritage.\u201d Indeed, repeated miscalculations in content and the reactions it produces could be sidestepped by giving on-the-ground teams more power to create legitimate brand messages.", "A commitment that evolves", "According to Javier Cavier, Senior Director at the marketing firm Ipos, an amount of evolution in the market is necessary. \u201cIf you look historically behind the location of shows, they were driven by three main factors: They were aspirational cities within fashion like Milan, designers were based there, and they were home to an influential industry,\u201d he says. But when it comes to China, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. \u201cIdeally, the long-term desire to develop a close relationship with an audience should be on a local level,\u201d adds Cavier. \u201cDesigners started with digital livestreaming from Western fashion weeks, and now, they step up to a physical presence. Plus, these shows are market-specific.\u201d", "For brand activations in the Chinese market, the message to audiences should be clear: We value you, and we want to connect with you, but this needs to be carried out consistently over time.", "Ample locations to choose from", "China has no shortage of destinations for shows, and while most companies choose to set their brand\u2019s standard in Shanghai or Beijing, but other cities are starting to emerge as important destinations. Chanel, for one, chose to stage its Cruise 2018 collection in Chengdu. Cavier outlines the reasons behind show location choices, saying, \u201cIn China, the separation between affluence and influence is very different. The two don\u2019t come together in the same way as they might in other countries.\u201d", "Take Chenyang in the Hunan province, for example. Cavier points out that the city was part of \u201cold China\u201d 20 years ago, but like many other second-tier and third-tier cities, it now has a lot of financial wealth. \u201cWestern houses can\u2019t necessarily do shows there as inhabitants can buy, but they can\u2019t necessarily influence,\u201d he says. \u201cHangzhou, on the other hand, home to Alibaba, might work, but [brands should] think a little harder about choices outside the capitols.\u201d", "This only adds fuel to the idea that Western brands must be ready to match domestic conglomerates and go deeper into the country to make their mark on the Chinese market.", "", "Boosted engagement and visibility", "When combining a physical runway and an online platform, Emma Sharley, CEO of the strategic marketing and branding consultancy Sharley Consulting, describes the nuances that brands should employ. \u201cFashion shows generate invaluable engagement for new and established luxury groups,\u201d she says. \u201cIn addition to the physical runway experience, brands are offering added consumer access by tapping into China\u2019s vast digital platforms. This allows fashion shows to reach a new level of sophistication, engage both discerning luxury buyers and consumers through exquisite and immersive experiences, and appeal to their underlying passion for the new.\u201d", "As part of last year\u2019s runway show, Valentino created a Mini Program on WeChat that displayed an array of content ranging from showpieces to celebrity outfits. The brand\u2019s CEO, Stefano Sassi, told Jing Daily in an exclusive interview last year that, years ago, the company would \u201cjust organized an event,\u201d and that was it. But, he adds, \u201cNow, we organize it and, in the meantime, provide this message to millions of consumers around the world. So, you have to work with the key partners that provide you with a high level of visibility.\u201d As Jing Daily reported, topics about the show skyrocketed up Weibo\u2019s trending list, thanks to the presence of multiple celebrities, and the hashtag #daydreamvalentino was mentioned over 300 million times on the platform. The show was followed by the launch of a capsule collection of the show in the brand\u2019s flagship store in Beijing\u2019s Sanlitun shopping plaza.", "Cons:", "Getting specialized designs right", "Burberry\u2019s runway show in April will primarily feature the collection it showed during London Fashion Week, but the fashion house will also drop new looks designed specifically for the Chinese market and available exclusively in China\u2019s stores and online platforms. Rachel Arthur, co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer of the communications, marketing, and PR agency Current Global, sees the value in this and stresses the need to cater to \u201cunique tastes and demands\u201d and the \u201cimportance of the product.\u201d", "But Porteous urges caution to labels that want to incorporate Chinese design, culture, or heritage into a collection. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult tightrope to walk,\u201d he states. \u201cDo it right, and you build a strong emotional connection with consumers. But get it wrong, and you risk being seen as patronizing or not truly understanding China.\u201d He continues, adding that cultural elements must be included based on design merit rather than just commercial expediency, as those maneuvers are \u201coften transparent and rightly derided.\u201d", "Being authentic", "For Cavier, brand leaders need to tread carefully in general when in China. \u201cThere is often a backlash when entities are seen as pandering to the wishes of the Chinese Government,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balancing act, but ask yourself: Can they be aspirational in the market but also be absolutely upfront and above board? So many things can be misconstrued by an audience that can take sentiments to new levels.\u201d", "We have seen how many ill-judged luxury strategies can damage reputations. Dior managed to bounce back from its recent faux pas relatively quickly and with little harm done thanks to some insightful measures. Cavier\u2019s suggestions for countering unexpected issues are simple: connect locally, be careful, and act cautiously. Due to what he calls \u201cidiocracies in the market,\u201d the way companies articulate their brand activations in China must be very specific. Accordingly, they can be \u201cirreverent, creative, and push boundaries, but there are limits.\u201d", "Choosing the right online tech partners", "Claudia Verbost, Commercial Director of the China-focused marketing and e-commerce agency AgencyChina, confirms that the big e-commerce giants \u2014 including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance \u2014 are all fighting to win over Western luxury companies. \u201cOnline is so crucial in China,\u201d she states. \u201cTencent is making more attractive WeChat programs and drops, while Alibaba\u2019s Luxury Pavillion continues to impress, along with other initiatives.\u201d\u00a0 While runway shows will undoubtedly benefit from these alignments, according to Verbost, an important question remains: \u201cWhich platform is the best for your brand?\u201d", "Making mistakes offline will affect a brand\u2019s online decisions \u2014 if not now then down the line. Burberry is collaborating with Tencent in Shenzhen to open a \u201csocial retail store\u201d while Prada has chosen to go it alone by launching their own e-commerce shop. And while there\u2019s risk in choosing a platform, Verbost admits that any choice is ultimately a massive opportunity.", "Facing sustainability concerns head-on", "Given the current climate crisis, the thought of another luxury brand flying across the world to present a runway show sits uneasily with many consumers. Yet, the situation shouldn\u2019t be seen in black-and-white terms. Arthur suggests that, in time, issues like this will become a key consideration as sustainability becomes less siloed. \u201cRight now brands need to react to a shifting landscape and reach more consumers through any means possible,\u201d he notes. \u201cOpening more stores is no longer the easiest route to market, hence the physical show can boost growth. But we know there is a huge amount of environmental impact from shows. There is a carbon footprint, but you\u2019d hope these people are on the ground [in China] already, and I\u2019d imagine they will try to offset this.\u201d", "Brooke Roberts-Islam, a fashion tech and sustainability innovator, says that there are additional areas \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d where brands can look to be more ethical. \u201cThere are other areas that need to be targeted, sampling in design for one, he states. \u201cThere\u2019s an amount of waste on carbon emissions associated with that, and I\u2019d be interested to see how that stacks up against flights.\u201d", "Staying ahead of rapidly shifting trends", "Verbost, who has offices located in both Europe and China, adds that brands should also take heed of the speed factor in China. \u201cThe market requires quick movement,\u201d she states, \u201cso the fact that luxury companies are only stepping up their runway shows now, alongside the fact that China still isn\u2019t the first location but a secondary add-on, proves they\u2019re still too slow.\u201d She wonders if these big juggernauts can adapt to the needs of a post-90s generation, particularly when it seems like millennials are focusing on local independent designers. \u201cHaving only lived through the years in which China was experiencing double-digit growth and worldwide success, the Post-90s generation is proud to be Chinese and therefore also proud of the Chinese luxury lines that the country has to offer,\u201d she adds.", "Whether or not Western brands can move fast enough to stay up-to-date and on-trend over the next couple of years will likely indicate where mainland Chinese consumers will be spending their money."]}, {"title": "What The 5G Revolution Means For Luxury Fashion", "meta": "January 23, 2020", "paragraphs": ["This post originally appeared on South China Morning Post Style, our content partner.\u00a0", "The identities of many luxury fashion brands are formed from the conceptual leadership of their founders.

This spending trend in the luxury sector parallels the overall outlook, according to Daniel Zipser, McKinsey\u2019s senior partner and co-author of the report, who adds: \u201cThe shoppers born in the 1980s are by far the largest group of spenders on luxury.", "The percentage of upper aspirant and mass affluent households in lower-tier cities are now in line with what the proportion was in high-tier cities five years ago, according to McKinsey. A few example cities in the report include Yancheng in the Jiangsu Province and Mianyang and Zigong in the Sichuan Province.", "One reason is that they are hit less hard by the economic slowdown compared to their counterparts in metropolises like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. They also tend to hesitate less about spending because they are less concerned about the rising cost of living, the report states.", "As growth in disposable income slows and consumption expenditure rises, many Chinese consumers are becoming discerning, savvy, and more frugal, according to the report. McKinsey highlights three additional consumer segments: (1) busy and affluent discerning consumers, (2) savvy shoppers, who are likely to be married females living in tier-1 cities and have time to compare products, and (3) young and single frugal consumers.", "Luxury brands may not find this trend so relevant, but they should take note of young consumers\u2019 growing sophistication. \u201cWhen you go back in time, Chinese luxury consumers only care about brands. But today, savvy consumers focus more on fabrics and design,\u201d Zipser said, adding \u201cthat it\u2019s no longer enough for brands just to be foreign and famous.\u201d", "While the report indicates that many consumers preferred Chinese brands over foreign ones for staple items like fresh food and household appliances, the preference has been expanded to more expensive premium products this year, the report discovers.", "The results are also nuanced when comparing respondents from different locations. When it comes to spending 8,000-20,000 yuan for a jacket, the report indicates that French and American brands are in the lead by a small margin for consumers from tier-1 and tier-2 cities. But consumers in tier-3 and tier-4 cities have a clear preference for Chinese brands over Western ones.", "Consumers are also developing a taste for carefully crafted clothes by homegrown designers like Ms MIN, Ming Ma and Angel Chen, which now appear alongside top Western brands in China\u2019s luxury department stores, according to the report. And despite the increased popularity for Chinese fashion, Zipser said that he has seen more successful cases in the premium beauty market. \u201cChinese brands are reaching the more premier end of category,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will take a much longer time for them to get to luxury fashion.\u201d"]}, {"title": "Can Macau Replace Hong Kong as a High-end Shopping Destination?", "meta": "January 22, 2020", "paragraphs": ["In the past few years, the city of Macau\u2019s ostentatious casinos and high-end stores have been attracting Chinese high-rollers. Interestingly enough, the appeal of Macau has grown exponentially as the chaos in Hong Kong lingers, and affluent mainlanders have warmed up to this former Portuguese territory.", "But Macau\u2019s rise as a high-end shopping destination didn\u2019t come overnight. The city made great progress back in 2007 when \u201cthe luxury retail industry was centered on the Mandarin Hotel, and there was nothing else,\u201d according to Michael Schriver, the former chief operating officer of DFS Group and current President North Asia, Louis Vuitton. This view is shared by David Sylvester, Senior Vice President of Retail at Sands Retail for Sands China Ltd., who told the South China Morning Post that when the group started leasing out the 330 retail spaces at the Venetian in 2005, the comment he kept hearing was \u201cthat Macau is for gaming, while Hong Kong is for shopping.\u201d According to Sylvester, the growth in gaming has reshaped the local retail ecosystem.", "Macau\u2019s economic boom is undisputedly linked to the city\u2019s dutiful and compliant approach to China\u2019s government, and if Hong Kong plays the role of \u201cwoke\u201d activist, Macau is more akin to the risk-averse brother who safely bets on seeking profitability and economic growth instead of total independence. Interestingly enough, both cities are governed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d structure, so one might expect the same revolutionary vibe from Macau that Hong Kong is displaying. History, however, has played an important role in Macau\u2019s development. While both cities were European colonies, one was governed by a crippled Portuguese power while the other was the crown jewel of the all-powerful British Empire.", "Over the years, the British government poured resources into Hong Kong and encouraged liberalism and the pursuit of equality and individual liberties. But Macau\u2019s situation was far more complex, given the complications that arose from the 1887 Lisbon Protocol. Many historians, in fact, argue that China and Portugal shared sovereignty of Macau even before the 20th century. Because of this, one could say that Macau\u2019s situation has created a dependent personality disorder, leading to the city\u2019s intensified respect for authority or dominant powers. This docility has made Macao a very wealthy city\u00a0 \u2014 one that continues to flourish at its own pace.", "Considering the turmoil in neighboring Hong Kong, it\u2019s safe to say that Macau\u2019s star will continue to rise, and the city\u2019s luxury boutiques have reported a sales growth thanks to affluent mainland buyers turning away from neighboring Hong Kong and embracing consumerism in Macau.", "Angelise Wu, a wealthy shopper from Beijing, told the Nikkei Asian Review that she won\u2019t buy luxuries in Hong Kong, even after the protests end. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like contributing to its economy,\u201d she said. This attitude is not uncommon, and there\u2019s a growing belief that \u201cdisobedient\u201d locals shouldn\u2019t be rewarded for their insurrection. Various posts appeared on Weibo and social media criticizing not only Hong Kongers but also foreign corporations that supported the protests. Examples include the french bank BNP Paribas coming under fire because one of its employees took a pro-democracy stand, a #BoycottCathayPacific hashtag that attracted over 17 million views and 8,000 comments, and how even a Taiwanese tea house named Yifang fell victim to social media outrage, with The Global Timesreporting that the #bubbleteaboycott attracted over 230 million views on Weibo.", "According to the German state-owned public international broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, and Claudia D\u2019Arpizio from Bain & Co., protests were responsible for over \u20ac2 billion in Hong Kong sales losses in 2019. Bain\u2019s recent report shows that Hong Kong\u2019s power is dwindling, and the city that once accounted for around 5 percent of global luxury sales now barely reaches 2 percent. Furthermore, the report argues that luxury sales in Hong Kong, which reached\u00a0 \u20ac10 billion ($11.09 billion) in 2013, will most likely drop to \u20ac6 billion for 2019.", "The protests have caused havoc for even the most acclaimed luxury conglomerates and businesses. Prada is not renewing its lease on Causeway Bay, vacating the property that was leased for \u20ac1 million in monthly rent. Burberry has registered an alarming \u201cdouble-digit\u201d decline in sales in Hong Kong, Chanel intended to inaugurate a store on Fashion Walk in the Causeway Bay district but temporarily suspended the project, Rimowa stopped short of opening a new store in the same district, and Louis Vuitton is shuttering its Times Square Mall store.", "Considering Hong Kong\u2019s dire perspectives, does Macao has the potential to replace the former and become the \u201cultimate shopping destination\u201d in the Asia-Pacific region? Here are some reasons why it could happen:", "First, the price discrepancies between Hong Kong and Macau have decreased significantly and will work in Macau\u2019s favor. Those famous shopping sprees that mainland luxury buyers used to take to Hong Kong should be replaced with trips to Macau, and we foresee luxury players further developing their assorted strategies in Macau and generating higher profit margins.", "Second, despite Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s latest tax cuts, Macau\u2019s luxury prices remain competitive. Therefore, it\u2019s safe to say that the city will soon compete not only with established Chinese shopping destinations, but also with international hot spots like Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand.", "In an increasingly patriotic country like China, local consumers appreciate loyalty. We\u2019ve seen on various occasions how companies that stand with China get endorsed by local entities and are rewarded with higher profit margins and increased consumer confidence. By contrast, businesses that engage in \u201cunpatriotic\u201d actions experience a full-force nationalistic backlash. For instance, Lenovo stirred controversy when CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview that the company is not a Chinese brand but a global one.", "That same \u201cChina-friendly\u201d attitude is even expected from strategic partners, and Beijing understands that the carrot-and-stick concept is perfect for keeping accomplices in check. As an example, President Xi Jinping visited Macau to commemorate the city\u2019s 20th-anniversary return to China last month, and according to CNBC, Xi Jinping will generously reward Macau\u2019s loyalty with a series of policies that will significantly impact on growth.", "Those policies include the establishment of a yuan-denominated stock exchange in the Chinese special administrative region and greater land allocation in mainland China for Macau to develop. All in all, Macau has been good to China, and Beijing\u2019s policies and pro-Macau stand are good for the local business community.", "After seven months of protests and political unrest, Hong Kong\u2019s retail scene is in bad shape. Many stores are at risk of closure, and Reuters reports that more than one in ten retailers in Hong Kong could close over the next six months. The Hong Kong Retail Management Association (HKRMA) said that retail sales decreased by a quarter in October 2019 from a year earlier, and tourist arrivals declined by 43.7 percent over the same period.", "By contrast, Macau is diversifying tourism to attract affluent visitors from Indonesia. WebBeds, the Macau Government Tourist Office, and some established Macau hotels including MGM Cotai and Hotel Lisboa have inaugurated a campaign designed specifically for Indonesian tourists. This diversification is a brilliant strategic move designed to lure consumers who traditionally belonged to the Hong Kong market.", "According to Skift and MGTO statistics, Macau saw a record of 35.8 million arrivals in 2018, with 71 percent of those visitors coming from the mainland and another 18 percent coming from Hong Kong. So it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that Macau wants to attract visitors from other countries, too.", "Macao has a strategic position in the Greater Bay Area, and it could easily replace Hong Kong as a trade hub. In fact, China revealed an ambitious plan last year proposing the creation of an \u201cinnovation cluster\u201d that would rival America\u2019s Silicon Valley by linking Macau, Hong Kong, and nine other Chinese cities via infrastructure projects.", "This would further consolidate the status of each urban settlement, including Macau, and since Hong Kong is losing its gloss and allure, Macao could be empowered to take the city\u2019s place as a top regional trade hub. This consolidation won\u2019t happen overnight, and significant development differences will hinder the process, but the fact that Macau has become a regional tourism and trade hub in only a decade proves that the city has immense potential.", "Right now, what the future holds for Hong Kong is unclear.

According to certain luxury executives, heritage brands that move further into off-price retail will suffer because of the affiliation with customers who are often perceived as non-conventional luxury buyers. Indeed, launching capsule collections aimed at entry-level luxury buyers can antagonize core consumers who will eventually stop signaling their status and privileged identity through that particular brand.", "The democratization of luxury has blossomed in an age when consumers seek novelty ahead of extravagance and affinity instead of superiority.

However, there\u2019s no unique solution for all cases and differentiating with finesse is the key to success.", "The segregation between different consumer segments starts from the get-go, and smart marketers understand that entry-level luxury buyers will look for product lines that have their own identity and strengths. Therefore, diffusion lines like D&G (from Dolce & Gabbana) or O Oscar (from Oscar de la Renta) that are crafted from lower quality fabrics and sold at less expensive prices are doomed to fail. Cutting corners and presenting cheap knockoffs of outdated designs doesn\u2019t work anymore.

China\u2019s fashion cities obviously can\u2019t compare to the heritage of historical fashion capitals, yet they are driving new agendas centered around tech and consumer experiences. The growing prominence of smaller fashion weeks in cities like Tbilisi, Helsinki, and Copenhagen has led to an interest in a more localized approach to fashion weeks in Europe, and a similar opportunity is being exploited in China. Therefore, for luxury brands that are serious about growing in the Chinese market, understanding the intricacies of China\u2019s fashion weeks is critical.", "While China\u2019s fashion weeks all stand to grow in size, they each also face unique challenges.

Local retailer, Zhuo Ai, founder of the boutique Dressing for Fun, says Chengdu was both in \u201can experimental stage\u201d and lacking the investment needed for a long-term vision. \u201cFor brands in the local area, alternative fashion weeks are useful for support, although I think there are not that many local designers in these cities,\u201d she adds.", "Moreover, while some designers and press people often favor international fashion weeks over local domestic ones, others simply ignore alternative fashion weeks entirely or feel too inexperienced to take part in them. Another stumbling block for committees is their failure to attract the locally-born or based independent talent that helps to add a \u201ccool\u201d factor. Yet there are still other gaps: Only Shanghai Fashion Week hosts a public-facing fashion weekend (following their official event), China lacks a men\u2019s fashion week despite growing interest in the sector, and the country\u2019s first Couture week only launched last month. Overall, so many different fashion weeks run by different organizations make one wonder if a siloed, disjointed system is even feasible.", "Yet, despite these obstacles, China\u2019s newer fashion weeks present an opportunity not only for local brands but international ones.

Like these cities, Guangzhou\u2019s long-held position as a production base means it can also offer brands access to large fabric wholesalers and markets. And while the event has yet to receive much global recognition, it\u2019s developing international ties by inviting brands from outside of China. Lawlor, who showed alongside several brands from the UK and Italy that were invited by Guangzhou fashion week, is optimistic about the event, saying, \u201cI think the international brands built some stable connections and the industry made orders.

This lineup includes brands from other domestic cities like Dalien alongside non-Chinese brands from over 20 countries.", "Why it matters to China: After the loss of international sponsor Mercedes Benz, China Fashion Week has struggled to attract attention both inside and outside of China. Now, having recently partnered with WWD China, it\u2019s showing a new effort to amplify its global reputation. As one of the last fashion weeks on the circuit, most buyers will have allocated budgets by the time it takes place, which means most brands showing there are dependent on the attendance of national buyers.

For Jarno Leppanen\u2019s emerging independent menswear brand Ka Wa Key, which is based in Hong Kong and London, the strategy is working. \u201cIt\u2019s a good combination of east meets west,\u201d he says. \u201cCenterstage is a brilliant gateway to the Asian market. I think it\u2019s a really useful platform for Hong Kong designers, and even though it competes with NYFW time-wise, it still manages to stand out as its own interesting event.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: With 50 offices globally, the HKTDC organizes a range of buying missions. Alongside local luxury retailers, close to 7,000 buyers from 74 countries and regions visited in 2019.

Chinese celebrity Hu Bing, who made an appearance at Feng Chen Wang, was the top-ranking influencer, bringing in $83,000 worth of MIV.", "For many Chinese designers, starting at LFWM is often ideal because of familiarity. London can become a second home after finishing their studies, visa permitting.

But moves like these are generally restrained. As a buyer, Petersson explains that schedule-hopping from the bigger brands can cause issues for younger labels. \u201cIt gets more complicated when one of the bigger brands goes off and decides to show in another city whilst one city is already starting to show,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is sometimes detrimental to the younger brands that tend to get the slots on the first or last day and are more likely to be affected by this.\u201d", "She suggests it can be good for younger brands to experiment, though, as this not only adds excitement to a schedule but has practical benefits. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that young designers are trying out new cities to get a feel for where they are best suited, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s especially beneficial where the label is established in an \u2018off-schedule\u2019 city like Shanghai, where you won\u2019t benefit from the full force of international buyers.\u201d", "Backstage at 8on8 FW20.

Ka Wa Key has shown in London, Finland, New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai thus far. \u201cLondon has a great atmosphere, but it\u2019s getting smaller.

It\u2019s a great city with great energy,\u201d he states.", "Like Ka Wa Key, most Chinese designers on the LFWM schedule featured women\u2019s looks as part of their collections in London, further threatening the stability of schedules. London\u2019s incubator Fashion East recently dropped its prestigious MAN platform, adding it into its women\u2019s sponsorship. Moreover, fashion weeks in Asia are usually mixed-gender. Former GQ Presents recipient, the US-based Private Policy, has gone one step further and switched to a womenswear schedule, presenting at NYFW in February. \u201cWe want to try a different fashion week schedule and keep exploring genderless fashion,\u201d explains co-designer, Siying Qu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to limit buyers or consumers but want them to feel comfortable.\u201d And while they are now, admittedly, \u201cfirmly embedded\u201d in New York, past slots at LFWM were useful. \u201cIt was a way to have more presence in Europe and open up the market with some shows,\u201d Qu adds. \u201cWe met with retailer Selfridges and now they carry us. London men\u2019s is very vibrant and exciting, and the city is still on the brand\u2019s radar.

But for young emerging designers, it can be confusing to the industry when a brand keeps swapping around.\u201d Since launching with GQ China, Xander Zhou has consistently shown at LFWM. This season, his conceptual designs exploring multiverses and inclusivity showcased a level of maturity that Lee considers integral to having a solid base. \u201cNow, after four or five years, we really know the brand,\u201d Lee says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good model for young, emerging Chinese designers to adopt.\u201d", "Xander Zhou FW20 Runway.

Ka Wa Key suggested it wasn\u2019t ideal for them, while the London-based duo Dan Shan, who are former regulars at LFWM, opted for a break, instead opting for a showroom at Pitti Immagine Uomo and a show in Shanghai. The Guangzhou-born Danxia Liu, one half of the label explains, saying, \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a better timeline to show later. Also, if you show in March or April, you have more chances of standing out. The buyers have a fresh memory. It\u2019s a bit more likely they won\u2019t forget what they have seen.\u201d", "What\u2019s clear is that showing internationally is important for brands back home \u2014 regardless of the place or timing. Standing out is vital, and Asian fashion weeks have a much lower MIV impact than London: An internal report by Launchmetrics stated that across Western channels, SS20 could be valued as follows: $8.2 million in Tokyo, $5.6 million in Seoul, and $2.1 million in Shanghai. As Yu suggests, showing internationally carries \u201cprestige\u201d for Chinese designers, and in this regard, designers need to break out and compete on the global stage. \u201cChinese consumers appreciate designers who are gaining recognition abroad and are keen to support and celebrate their success,\u201d she adds. \u201cChinese designers could make this a key part of their marketing strategy.\u201d", "On the ground level, brands like Dan Shan are writing a new rulebook by being flexible. Liu is confident that when choosing where to show, brands don\u2019t have to follow pre-existing routes. \u201cThese days, it simply doesn\u2019t really matter where you show or even what time.

Their formulas which include a distinctive DNA, grass-root marketing, and constant revision of product formula due to consumer demand, are drastically different to luxury brands with who have a controlled brand image, precise merchandizing and trendsetting design. In China, homegrown brands and Taobao vendors will react to consumer brands both in design and customer service terms. Already, local brand Perfect Diary communicated with consumers and reacted to the latest social trends by dropping special editions.

Some principal players have leveraged the intersection between contemporary art and fashion to explore the socio-cultural issues that resonate with young consumers, for example, Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cComing of Age,\u201d curated by Virgil Abloh.

According to Ke, American singles tend to pay more attention to a brand\u2019s symbolic lifestyle, such as the case of Lululemon and the whole athleisure wellness trend. In China, a brand\u2019s visual aesthetic still has a more immediate impact than the lifestyle it embodies. \u201cChinese singles also face much more stimuli to spend from social selling platforms integrated into social apps.

In many other single economies, being single means embracing freedom and life\u2019s vast opportunities. Yet in China, it is an act of rebellion against social norms defined by the older generations. \u201cOur generation is starting to realize that happiness is not confined in the realm of hormones or romantic love,\u201d Zoe Zhao says. \u201cHappiness could come from friendship, lifestyle, family, and other areas of life.

Consequently, after years of negative press, many professionals forgot about the positive benefits of licensing and how it can create win-win situations. Today, however, though a large number of luxury and premium brands have licensing agreements for their accessories and cosmetics lines, it seems like the newer practice of collaborating may be taking root.", "Licensing versus collaboration", "Younger consumers won\u2019t remember that there was a time when fashion collaborations seemed impractical and utopian.

It includes a light, which when you turn it on, transforms the box into a lantern (one of the ancient lighting tools). It also contains a transparent rotatable \u2018Pingfeng,\u2019 an item of Chinese classical furniture used to block the wind or sight. In terms of brand specialty, Fendi has printed their logo on the outside of the gift box and on each mooncake housed inside it. As for taste, the mooncakes reflect both the traditional Chinese culture along with a more modern Western approach. One is filled\u00a0 with red wine cranberry (Western); another is filled with egg yolk lotus (traditional).

As for the mooncakes, they\u2019re tucked away in Tiffany blue boxes. Another thing we really liked about Tiffany\u2019s approach was that it was practical. Once you\u2019ve finished your mooncakes, the box itself can be used as a stylish table lamp.", "Courtesy of Prada", "Prada", "Prada went with an entirely different approach, creating a circular gift box printed in their popular banana print. Once opened, six mooncakes were arranged in a circle, expressing the meaning of reunion perfectly, which is the main point of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Though it was less ornate than the other gift boxes, we thought Prada did a great job of staying on brand while also capturing the meaning of the festival.", "Courtesy of Mr. Bags", "Gucci", "Gucci produced probably the most expensive mooncake gift box this year, but still lost the battle because of a lack of cultural resonance. Gucci\u2019s mooncakes come in a heavy red suitcase, with six mooncakes housed in six tin boxes, each decorated with a different Gucci pattern, and finally, they\u2019ve included a portable chess set on the left side of the box. The problem with Gucci\u2019s design, apart from the mooncakes themselves, is that there\u2019s very little related to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

While Hong Kong will always be a major market for luxury brands, they are undoubtedly feeling the sting of store closures due to mainland Chinese shoppers opting to do their high-end shopping in other cities. And the lingering sense of uncertainty about how long the protests will last certainly isn\u2019t helping matters.", "L\u2019Occitane Vice-Chairman Andre Hoffmann recently summarized the situation by saying, \u201cHong Kong has been challenging\u2026 We lost several trading days in the quarter due to the protests. Chinese tourists spending in our shops has declined. All these are a bad cocktail for our business.\u201d But some brands have made their prospects in the city even murkier thanks to badly timed scandals that have forced them to make very public apologies in mainland China (these include Versace, Coach, Givenchy, and Swarovski, which all recently produced luxury items or marketing campaigns that \u201churt the feelings\u201d of Chinese authorities.) For Hong Kong natives who sympathize with the protests, the perception that brands are actively groveling to Beijing at this time could also leave a mark that lasts long past the current protests.", "But Hong Kong is just one area where brands are in the dark right now. Luxury brands face big questions in mainland China caused by a slowing economy and a recent currency devaluation \u2014 both primarily caused by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Most brands will likely need to raise prices in mainland China to account for a devalued yuan, and with no sense of certainty that the yuan won\u2019t continue to lose value, brands will be less likely to invest in store renovations and cosmetics brands will likely think twice before investing in new products aimed at the China market.", "Meanwhile, the future of the outbound Chinese tourist shopper \u2014 whose high-end hauls have arguably powered the luxury market over the last decade \u2014 is another question mark during this year of uncertainty. Although Chinese shoppers continue to travel and spend, where they\u2019re doing it is changing quickly. While Japan expects a solid year of Chinese tourist arrivals and purchases, the outlook is less than stellar in Thailand, and the U.S. is expecting a particularly large decline in Chinese arrivals and shopping that could stretch on for months to come. So the question for brands wanting to cater to this demographic becomes: Where should they focus their efforts?", "Brands must also reckon with a general decline in Western brand dominance in China, particularly among the country\u2019s younger shoppers. Although it is far too early to say whether or not local high-end brands can fully supplant the entrenched luxury players in China, competition is increasing in this market. As the New York Times\u00a0noted in its overview of Alibaba\u2019s recent financial results, \u201cAnalysts say the trade war with the United States has prompted shoppers to become more selective, and many have switched to buying domestic brands that they feel are of high quality.\u201d Particularly in the cosmetics and skincare market, Western brands in China face stiff competition from agile, digitally savvy brands from South Korea, Japan and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 even China itself.", "Now the open question for most major brands is how to approach the Greater China market \u2014 Hong Kong in particular \u2014 over the rest of 2019 and 2020. As many luxury commentators see it, regardless of how long the protests last, the status of Hong Kong as a financial, hospitality, luxury, and fashion epicenter has been altered; but the degree to which it\u2019s been altered remains to be seen. While some say this summer\u2019s protests mean that it\u2019s time for corporate businesses to \u201cstick a fork\u201d in Hong Kong, others are more cautious, pointing out that Hong Kong is a large city and the protests, while hugely significant and sizeable, are still limited to specific parts of the city and are limited in their disruption.", "The type of sentiment that says Hong Kong is finished as a major business center and will lose ground to Singapore likely takes too short a view of the city\u2019s history. While this summer\u2019s protests have perhaps been the longest and most violent in the recent past (as compared to the \u201cUmbrella Revolution\u201d of 2014), major brands will likely face some short-term pain but a long-term outlook that ultimately settles back to where it was at the beginning of the year (in other words, a less prosperous yet still significant \u2018normal\u2019).", "A long-term decline in sales in Hong Kong would be less due to mainland Chinese tourists\u2019 fear of protests than it would factors like how well the Chinese economy is doing overall, including the general appetite for luxury travel and shopping. As such, brands shouldn\u2019t \u2014 and likely won\u2019t \u2014 make immediate plans to pull back their Hong Kong investments or presence. Some businesses, particularly those in the hospitality market, are historically too invested in the market to ever cut back there anyway. The most likely course ahead is that brands will try and stay under the radar and limit their revenue damage as much as possible while they wait for things to settle into the new normal.

And how can they see the early warning signs that consumers are losing interest in a particular item?", "Traditionally, Western companies have relied heavily on market research surveys. An iconic luxury brand recently told me about their experiences with these studies in China. In short, they called them a disaster. They tried surveying customers in China using conventional market research methods, but they generated almost no actionable insights, and they weren\u2019t sure if the results were even relevant, because they couldn\u2019t cover enough cities in China.

Many believe they can launch in China with approaches similar to the ones they use in other regions and fail as a result. The ultra-dynamic, vast, and fast-changing Chinese market requires a sophisticated, data-driven management approach.

Most importantly, the company\u2019s entire data infrastructure needs to be structured in a way that connects all data sources so relationships between them can be identified and understood.", "But why exactly is AI so important, and how can luxury brands apply it in China? Imagine this typical challenge many luxury companies face: A luxury brand in China has an aging consumer profile and isn\u2019t appealing to Millennials and Gen Zers. Its flagship stores in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong don\u2019t have enough foot traffic and can\u2019t generate enough revenue to cover their costs.

They may switch their advertising agency, run promotions that just erode brand equity, or try out new campaigns or influencers. They may even develop a WeChat Mini Program. But, if they lack fundamental insights on what\u2019s wrong with the branding, there is a high probability that all those measures will change nothing or even compound their problems.", "Instead, a company should use machine learning and a sophisticated AI engine to analyze all available data points, including the millions of conversations consumers have about the brand online, which can be challenging because of the firewalled Chinese internet. Afterward, the brand should understand the precise consumer sentiment about itself, and, more importantly, the changes in that sentiment over time. This analysis goes beyond simple social media listening because it gathers data across several brand touchpoints (from store foot traffic to online sales) to create a model of how changes in sentiment impact purchase patterns. Only then can a brand identify the real reasons for its negative performance, which could be anything from weak brand positioning to inefficient communication campaigns. Only then can a company develop precise strategies to strengthen its brand and its performance while also identifying significant marketing savings and efficiency gains.", "China is one of the most attractive markets for luxury brands today, but it is also one of the most challenging.

And this is particularly true when speaking of customers buying luxury bags.\u201d It\u2019s clear that individuality and self-expression are important for younger demographics, and Chinese millennials and Gen-Zers glorify luxury brands that respect their individuality and respond to their peculiar needs. Since the primary in-demand quality of a heritage brand is \u2018exclusivity,\u2019 most luxury buyers have become less enthusiastic about mass production. Consequently, younger consumers want to be involved in the design process by leaving their mark on the end product.", "A 2015 research paper from Deloitte named \u201cThe Deloitte Consumer Review. Made-to-order: The rise of mass personalization\u201d states that 36 percent of consumers are interested in buying personalized products while 48 percent don\u2019t mind waiting longer for customized luxury goods. Meanwhile, the 2017 Deloitte research paper \u201cBling it on. What makes a millennial spend more?\u201d shows that 40.6 percent of Chinese millennial consumers don\u2019t mind paying a premium for a personalized product, while in the U.S., 71.4 percent would pay a premium. This shows how popular customized luxury goods have become around the world and how this trend still has room for growth in China.", "It should be noted here that a correlation between fashion styles and the economy is often recognized. Some retail experts argue that in times of recession, trendsetters embrace conspicuous consumption and more restrained aesthetics, while conversely, during a phase of economic expansion, consumers welcome splashy extravagance. Not surprisingly, in China \u2014 a country where the economy is booming and young consumers consider themselves brands \u2014 the customization trend is in high demand. China\u2019s millennial and Gen-Z luxury consumers interpret personalization as a resource that helps them fulfill their right to self-expression and unabashed individualism.", "Longchamp was one brand that was at the forefront of this current customization trend. Way back in 2004, the French luxury leather goods company launched the first customized Le Pliage\u00ae Personalized handbag. It was extremely popular, and as Sophie Delafontaine told Jing Daily, Longchamp \u201ckept on renewing it ever since \u2014 particularly when we decided to add Le Pliage\u00ae Cuir a decade later.\u201d She points out that through personalization, customers have \u201cthe opportunity to create their very own it-bag.\u201d", "But today\u2019s focus on customization can even be seen in smaller labels. Robert Wun is a Hong-Kong born fashion designer best known for his signature edgy style and sculptured silhouettes. Recently, he told Jing Daily, \u201cThe Robert Wun brand is always about uniqueness,\u201d and the designer has forged a customer-centric model where he discusses ideas with specific clients in order to construct a bespoke luxury product for them.", "Wun says that \u201cthere is a particular joy and satisfaction in made-to-order designs with specific clients,\u201d because, throughout the process, the designer understands the needs of the customer, while the buyer sees the effort going into a bespoke design. This process of creating alongside the designer strengthens the bond between them both, but it\u2019s impossible for many luxury brands to offer a truly bespoke experience. Fortunately, a connection with the audience can be constructed through monogramming or new personalization processes.", "Louis Vuitton\u2019s Hot Stamping program, for instance, lets buyers hot stamp their monograms on small leather products. This process is available in select Louis Vuitton flagship stores, comes complimentary, and is quick (requiring just a few minutes of the buyer\u2019s time). Consequently, an exclusive item produced at a large scale can still become exclusive to the consumer through a personalization process \u2014 one that\u2019s faster and more cost-effective than a bespoke design.", "\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for unique pieces,\u201d according to Sophie Delafontaine, and that\u2019s why Longchamp is focusing more and more on personalization. And now that mass customization is easier to carry out, younger consumers can fully embrace their favorite brands by making each luxury product exclusive to them.

While Western societies are largely individualistic, usually emphasizing the need for distinctiveness, China is ruled by collectivism. As a result, it has become a society where individuals respect social norms and aspire to achieve conformity while being assimilated into strong, cohesive social groups. Therefore, in China, luxury goods are more than the peripheral status symbols they are in the West; they\u2019ve become badges of success. For affluent buyers, the fastest and easiest way to convey their role as a winner in society is through luxury consumption.", "However, the younger generations don\u2019t play by the same rules.

The sharing economy is sabotaging craftsmanship and the artisan-made production", "The blueprint of a luxury product demands effort, exceptional skills, and several hundreds of hours of labor.

During his time at Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld was praised for perpetuating centuries-old craftsmanship\u00a0through collaborations with Lesage, Desrues, Lemari\u00e9, and Maison Michel. As expected, a design that requires several hundreds of hours of labor is close to an art piece and this increases the value of the product. But in the shared economy, these garments pass from buyer to buyer, losing their uniqueness and appeal. High-end apparel was not intended to become conventional but aspirational and rare. The scarcity of the designs pushed the market price up, but if the garments are available to a wider public, the price falls again.

It\u2019s a Western concept \u2014 a sensibility that glorifies bad taste or irony \u2014 that doesn\u2019t naturally resonate with Chinese who come from a completely different culture. But the desire for people to check out fashion\u2019s largest annual extravaganza, along with the red carpet filled with celebrities in outlandish outfits, still took Chinese social media sites by storm.", "Starting early last night, a number of\u00a0 Met Gala-related topics surged onto the trending board of China\u2019s social media platform Weibo, which is still the best place to currently measure and monitor the online sentiments of Chinese netizens.

For example, the Hollywood actor Ezra Miller, who was dressed by Burberry\u2019s new creative director Riccardo Tisci, caught a wide range of opinions on Chinese social media due to his eccentric look. So did the Kardashian family, who were dressed by a throng of brands ranging from Versace to Tommy Hilfiger.", "Even though this year\u2019s theme was far from relatable to the majority of Chinese people, the massive amount of Chinese interest in the event \u2014 and the beautifully dressed people attending it \u2014 points to a big opportunity for luxury brands that want to create a meaningful conversation with Chinese consumers in the future, regardless of the gala\u2019s theme."]}, {"title": "Less is More: Can Sustainability And Profit Co-Exist?", "meta": "May 5, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Fashion is one of the most wasteful industries.

This practice, apparently common in the fashion industry, has spurred criticism from not only shareholders, but also from consumers worried about the environmental impact of this practice and others in the fashion industry. Now, the topic of sustainability is reaching a new height, with many luxury brands, such as Stella McCartney, Gucci, and Herm\u00e8s\u00a0issuing \u201csustainability\u201d statements, announcing their stand for this approach loud and clear.", "But what exactly is sustainable fashion? As much as it has become a buzz word throughout the industry today, there seems to be a gap between what consumers think it is what business actually need to do to make it happen. According to a report commissioned by the financial services corporation ING, entitled, \u2018From Sustainability to Business Value Finance,\u2019 the top three reasons for implementing sustainability targets in business today are driven by the desire to grow revenue (39%), reduce costs (35%), and/or protect their brand (30%).

The luxury conglomerate Kering\u2019s push for transparency in China resulted in them creating a Mini Program, \u201cMy EP&L,\u201d which allows users to calculate the environmental \u201cprofit and loss\u201d of their purchases in general (or a \u2018moral score,\u2019 if you may). Ideally, consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions based on a score that is broken down by the materials, the sourcing of materials, and the manufacturing region of a product. However, whether consumers are actively using the program to make ethical choices is yet to be examined. And would they really purchase something based on how high of an environmental-friendly score they can get? The answer is unknown.", "Some, especially the younger generations, even question whether or not they should contribute to environmental problems by constantly buying new clothes. Many now opt to shop at second-hand stores or at rental fashion shops and apps. This may be bad news for the industry whose under pressure to sell, but deep down, both business and consumers\u2019 intentions seem to be increasingly aligned \u2014 that is to maximize the value of fashion products we wear and are produced.", "It\u2019s a balancing act of supply and demand, argued Wang, who is the third generation of a family rooted in the apparel industry, in Hong Kong. \u201cThe problem never comes from the manufacturer side, they are extremely waste-conscious,\u201d she says. Instead, the problem happens in the planning side \u2014 on how to best design and sell to the market. Wang\u2019s company believes sizing is an important step to make this process more efficient, by creating an understanding of pattern making and garment production to help brands, designers, and retailers ensure their products achieve the best possible fit. (The company has recently published a report advocating that profit can coexist well with a social and environmental impact.)", "Educating consumers doesn\u2019t happen overnight, to be sure, but adjusting supply and demand to plan for little or no unsold goods can also be managed. Luxury brands may have the privileges and resources to grant consumers the \u201ctrophy,\u201d by charging a premium price for sustainable goods, which leaves a great deal of margin to exploit.

Ten years later, Professor Wu explained to Jing Daily that \u201csince a great number of Chinese consumers gained access to global luxury fashion, luxury brands start to lose their appeal to the Chinese fashion leaders, precisely as they are no longer exclusive. Thus, they can no longer provide the social distinction that the fashion leaders desire.\u201d Besides Western labels\u2019 diminishing exclusivity, China\u2019s increasingly woke consumers have become less tolerant of Western luxury brands that commit egregious cultural faux pas. \u201cThe new generation of Chinese are less forgiving than their parents on any cultural mistakes that global fashion brands may make, such as the recent Dolce & Gabbana case,\u201d said Professor Wu. For that, we can thank that nation\u2019s booming economy, which has bred a steroidal sense of cultural pride into China\u2019s younger generations, who use social media to facilitate massive-scale brand boycotts against offending international companies such as Zara, Burberry, Balenciaga, and the aforementioned D&G.", "China\u2019s unprecedented level of interest in fashion has also contributed to the shifting consumer attitude towards the country\u2019s own fashion makers. \u201cChina was never short of fashion talents,\u201d said Steven An, the founder of Chi Design, a made-in-China overseas rebranding organization that brought seven Chinese designers to showcase at Milan Fashion Week 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s just nobody was noticing them in the past.

The shift from looking out to looking in is only just happening now. Chi Design founder, Steven An, told Jing Daily that \u201cafter 20 years of American-style capitalization, [the fashion market in] China is very commercial now.

Our manufacturing is growing, we have the world\u2019s fashion market and all that, but we still lag decades behind in fashion background and taste development.\u201d A conservatism within the traditional fashion centers paradoxically poses a problem, too.

Customers won\u2019t want a mini-program if they have no idea who you are, so start slowly.\u201d", "2. Personal Connection Counts", "The reason influencer marketing can be so successful in China is down to trust. Fans trust the word of popular KOLs who have proven themselves in the past by recommending authentic and valuable products and brands. This personal connection is key to brands looking to launch in the Chinese market, as Knight explained, \u201cThere are many ways brands seek to connect with Chinese customers online. It\u2019s important to remember that although posts and likes are useful, they only tell one side of the story. Brands now need to work harder and harder to push shoppers offline, and there are examples of brands offering vouchers through WeChat to encourage physical footfall in store. Live streaming is another way to build individual connections with consumers, bridging the gap between stale online posts, though with a more personal approach.\u201d", "3. Beware Influencer Scams", "Jing Daily recently reported that Chinese influencers yield far better returns than their Western counterparts. This was due, in part, to less competition for advertising platforms, more opportunity to diversify revenue streams, and fewer influencer rules and regulations. Given this, it\u2019s no wonder that working with Chinese influencers is a boon for Western luxury brands.", "However, due to the millions of Chinese influencers out there, Tong Digital co-founder James Campbell warns brands to beware, \u201cThe right influencer for your brand can be the difference between an iconic marketing campaign and a complete flop. You only need to look in the past at some of the mistakes made by some of the luxury giants to see how careful you should be. Unfortunately, because of how easy it is to become an influencer in China, there are lots of people buying followers and likes, and making it seem like their reach is a lot larger than it actually is. Without an experienced team in China, brands can be tricked by these influencers, and lose a lot of money.

This type (of model) actually has been working very well, because the influencer has established an audience base who trust them. I think more brands will work with influencers instead of hosting their own events.", "Ray: I think the whole allure of live streaming is that people are not just watching, but commenting and sending gifts, and the host is interacting with them the whole time.

Whether they are traveling or not, the campaign allowed consumers to free their minds from their busy city lives and find some zen via this natural imagery.", "\u201cMost Western brands are at their first few attempts to [connect with] Chinese consumers, so they fall into the folklore of Chinese icons and portraits of pigs,\u201d said Laurent about this common pitfall.

Yet time and time again, companies ignore the advice of the experts they\u2019ve hired \u2014 and often with disastrous results. Angela Wang, who works on a China marketing team for an American premium brand, explained how the New York headquarters insisted on using a white American celebrity as a brand ambassador for a Chinese campaign, overriding the Chinese team\u2019s strong veto on the decision. \u201cShe is very little known in China, nor in Asia,\u201d said Angela. \u201cWe all thought it was a marketing budget waste.\u201d Alternative ideas were suggested, she added, but they went unheard.", "The danger of these marketing pitfalls doesn\u2019t mean a brand has to play it safe with their marketing either \u2014 in fact, the opposite is true.

A recent example is Maybelline\u2019s wildly popular Chinese New Year Mahjong products, which drew inspiration from the popular Qing Dynasty game.", "Today, more and more luxury fashion brands are paying close attention to the Chinese market, but in order to succeed there, they have to go beyond cultural clich\u00e9s and really connect with contemporary Chinese people.

Of course, some brands are more optimistic \u2014 Burberry, for example, in their latest quarterly financial results, noted that there was an increase in Chinese tourist spending at its shops in the UK, while it also saw a mid-single-digit increase in sales in China during the same quarter.", "This likely means that domestic factors are influencing Chinese spending habits. As the Chinese government introduced new regulations concerning luxury goods purchased abroad, fewer travelers may be willing to bring back expensive items from their overseas holidays. In addition, the government has also been promoting domestic consumption, and luxury brands have made an effort to close the price gap between goods sold in China and abroad. This has all led to fewer reasons to seek shopping opportunities overseas in an effort to save money.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that Chinese tourists aren\u2019t shopping while on vacation.

Price was the third most important factor for the second consecutive year. The shopping locations have even grown more diverse, expanding beyond duty-free shops and retail outlets to convenience stores, cosmetics shops, and gift shops. The implication is that Chinese travelers are more savvy shoppers than they used to be \u2014 they know what\u2019s available at home and the comparable prices.", "Besides spending less on luxury products abroad, it has been previously reported that Chinese tourists are spending less per trip but traveling more frequently. For less affluent travelers, this means that the experience of travel is the main expense \u2014 and those travelers are seeking more experiences at destinations. This experiential trend is particularly true with respect to younger Chinese travelers, who seek out experiences they can share with travel partners or on social media.", "And while some claim that Chinese tourists aren\u2019t quite enthusiastic about shopping overseas, the Nielsen report indicates that 24.6 percent of expenditures abroad are still attributed to shopping, a proportion that exceeds even accommodation expenses.

We are excited to introduce you to some of our new collections here, and speak about their inspirations.\u201d A Chinese sales associate spoke softly in Mandarin.", "\u201cThis collection is inspired by the May 1968 protests in France, the patchwork on the clothes imitates wall posters; you can spot them as on the wall of the runway show.\u201d The sales associate led us to the new collection pieces and seemed to transport us to the front row of the runway show.", "One of the students trying on earrings from Dior.", "As her voice faded into the background, I noticed how big the store is\u2013it covers a wide range of products, from ready-to-wear and jewelry to shoes and accessories. I spoke with a group of girls crowding near the jewelry counter; one of them was trying on a jewelry set priced at $600.

Chinese heartthrob singer Wu Yifan, or Kris Wu, has worked as a Burberry brand ambassador, and was invited to walk the runway for the company in 2016 and instantly became an internet sensation.", "Even though the sales associate was not Chinese, he knew a lot about Chinese clients. \u201cChinese luxury buyers are younger and very attentive to the change of designers. They are into new and funky lines rather than classical collections, but their love of trench coats never changes,\u201d he said.", "\u201cIn fact, if you are interested in the new collection from Riccardo Tisci, the new items will drop in stores in October,\u201d he gestured to a piece of paper for us to write on. \u201cJust leave your phone number and email here, and we will get in touch with you.\u201d", "A student is taking pictures at the Christian Louboutin store.", "Nan debated whether to put down her information, but Qian directed her out of earshot and whispered, \u201cI have the WeChat contact of a sales associate in New York. They have more collections and fresher stuff.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s still worth looking around here though, because sometimes Copley might have different collections that are hard to get elsewhere.

Konig said they hope to host another event like this in the near future.", "In an age where social media is the new currency, Copley seems to recognize the soft power of these mini-influencers, who are generating word-of-mouth exposure that can\u2019t be bought elsewhere."]}, {"title": "What Upheaval At One Shanghai Mall Says About China\u2019s Luxury Market", "meta": "October 5, 2018", "paragraphs": ["What\u2019s the changing landscape of luxury in China?

But suddenly, logos are becoming important to fashion consumers in China, and fashion houses are responding with a bevy of new logo designs and applications.", "Sales associates who interact with clients understand this best. For instance, Lucy, a sales associate at a New York City luxury brand store, noticed that mature, affluent Chinese consumers learn about how logos reflect a designer\u2019s ideology and philosophy, and she said they enjoyed feeling more \u201cin the know\u201d about these symbols.

So which approach is seen as more \u201cauthentic\u201d by consumers?", "The answer is: It\u2019s hard to say.

Drawing on Curiosity China\u2019s latest report and Bonhomme\u2019s expertise, we picked out 10 examples that set the standard for best practices.\u00a0", "1. Most Engaging", "Guerlain\u2019s additive Tetris lottery game", "To celebrate its latest lipstick, the KissKiss Matte collection, Guerlain partnered with a major player in duty-free shopping, Sunrise Duty-Free, to create a WeChat game. Within 10 days of its launch, the campaign attracted 18,582 page views and 10,000 players.", "Bonhomme says, \u201ca standard post is not enough anymore.

Most Beneficial", "Michael Kors\u2019 membership program", "Michael Kors launched a mini-program that focused on membership services, becoming the first luxury brand to do so. Now when consumers are shopping in a Michael Kors store, they can check product details in real-time. They can also review the shopping experience and access after-sale service benefits using the mini program.", "Bonhomme says, \u201cAs one of the first luxury brands focusing on membership services on Wechat, this mini-program truly offered added-value for the online-offline customer experience.\u201d", "3. Most Thoughtful", "Kering Group\u2019s Environment P&L mini-program", "Kering\u2019s mini-program, \u201cMy EP&L\u201d, allows users to calculate the environmental \u201cprofit and loss\u201d of their purchases. They can make more informed decisions based on a score that is broken down by materials, sourcing of materials, and the manufacturing region of a product. It offers tremendous transparency about the supply chain of a given luxury item.", "Bonhomme says, \u201cKering\u2019s informative and engaging mini program leads the new trend of CRS communication in the market. The campaign enabled the company to have a distinguished eco-friendly image among Chinese customers.\u201d", "4. Most Creative", "Longchamp\u2019s community sharing app", "This location-based photo sharing platform allows users to search Longchamp\u00a0store locations, and use a digital map to navigate their way there. The subpage for each location is designed to look and feel like the WeChat moment sharing pages. Users can check in and share photos of their Longchamp bags within a mini-community.", "Bonhomme says, \u201cThis is\u00a0a creative way to interact with fans. Instead of using Wechat as a one-to-one communication tool between the brand and the customers, Longchamp made a distinct use of Wechat by encouraging fans to share with each other inside its mini-community.\u201d", "5. Most Shareable", "Gucci\u2019s WeChat gift cards", "Gucci\u2019s gift card mini-program combines two highly shareable functions\u2014one is a photo editor, which allows users to add customized Gucci stickers to their photos, while another one is e-gift cards for small items like perfume, wallet, candles, and cups. Once purchased, the user can send the card directly to their friends via WeChat, and the gift can then be picked up from a Gucci retail store.", "Bonhomme says, \u201cThe campaign was very much welcomed for its personalized experience and fun social value.

Most Functional", "Burberry appointment", "The goal of Burberry\u2019s mini-program is to drive traffic to retail stores while complimenting its in-store services. Users can make plans to visit specific stores at specific times, and supplement their accounts with important personal information. They can also chat one-on-one with an online customer service representative via this mini-program.

The featured items and celebrities\u2019 names were highlighted as search tags. ", "Bonhomme says, \u201cLeveraging the right KOL or celebrity to educate and empower consumers enabled Stuart Weitzman to build an emotional and interactive connection with their consumers.

Most Exciting", "Dior\u2019s balloon game", "This interactive game was created to generate awareness for the grand opening of a new Dior store in Shanghai. As long as users collected all six in-game Dior items, they could set off in a virtual hot air balloon and witness the real event in front of Plaza 66.

", "Over the past decade, I\u2019ve trained and coached thousands of retail managers and sales associates in China. I\u2019ve seen the churn up close. I believe retention is a managerial issue:", "Studies show that higher pay doesn\u2019t solve the problem. Retention is really a measure of how much managers communicate care and provide individualized reinforcement to the sales associate. It requires redefining the job in terms of relationship and service.", "Your Customers Aren\u2019t Your Only Customers", "What happens when we treat sales associates like valued customers? Their behavior reflects it. If you want engaged, happy clients who love coming into your store, you need engaged, happy employees who love working there. Obvious, right? Yet this is not on the radar of many managers. They manage as they were managed, through positional power, not realizing that the dynamic has changed to one of personal power.", "Consider the parallel: a sales associate\u2019s position no longer ensures influence with customers (the sales associate must show value by helping customers find things they can\u2019t find for themselves). Likewise, managers who believe their power is positional instead of personal will never develop relationships with the members of their sales teams. In the absence of a relationship, sales associates will jump ship.", "In customer relationships, I stress three key factors: authenticity, personalization, and relevance\u2014all essential in retaining today\u2019s sales associates. Luxury sales associates take 6-12 months to translate training into success, so retention goes straight to ROI\u2014but without authentic relationships with managers, they\u2019re unlikely to last that long.", "First, What Doesn\u2019t Work?", "I\u2019ve observed four managerial behaviors that frustrate sales teams and cause high turnover:", "When sales associates feel ignored, they ignore their jobs. That can happen on big sales teams, which are common in China, or small. Remember, nearly every Chinese worker is an only child. They were brought up to expect personal attention from anyone in authority. One sales associate at a Shanghai luxury told me, \u201cMy boss doesn\u2019t even know my birthday!\u201d ", "The same Shanghai sales associate said, \u201cMy boss only tells me what I\u2019m doing wrong, and has never once told me I did something right.\u201d Many managers feel their job is to correct employee mistakes. Allow me to correct this managerial mistake. Constant criticism makes for sullen, unengaged workers. Sales associates treat the customer in much the same way that they are treated by management. \u00a0What kind of customer relationships do you want? Recognize even the small positives, giving reasons for why they were done well and citing their impact. This will provide the motivation sales associates need to be expressive and engaged with today\u2019s luxury customers.", "Empathy is an amplifier for active listening. You would never tune out a customer expressing a need or sharing a story. Be curious about your people. Again, employees from one-child families are used to focused attention. Empathetic listening can reveal the Sales Associate\u2019s \u00a0unique motivations. This in turn models how their own empathy can draw out what luxury customers want. ", "This plays out as both a lack of personalized feedback or recognition and a tendency to blame Millennial attitudes (\u201centitled\u201d or \u201cunmotivated\u201d) for declining sales. Managers must own their role and understand what matters most to each individual employee. While some sales associates respond to better pay, some simply want to excel, to be number one. Others love being brand ambassadors, or part of a great team. The manager\u2019s job is not to motivate\u2014it\u2019s to inspire, at this personal level. Sales associates have to motivate themselves. ", "Where Does Inspiration Come From?", "The bad news is, you can\u2019t just raise sales associate pay and get inspired results. That\u2019s also good news. What works doesn\u2019t directly involve pay increases. Instead, it involves helping managers make the transition from positional power to personal power. This requires a change in mindset and the acquisition of 21st century managerial skills, including ways to manage with meaning, control and appreciation.", "Martin Shanker is the President of sales consultancy Shanker Inc, which has worked with\u00a0Ralph Lauren, Burberry, Cartier, Lane Crawford, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Van Cleef & Arpels, Piaget, Yves Saint-Laurent, and many other luxury brands."]}, {"title": "Even Giorgio Armani is Launching an E-commerce Flagship on Tmall", "meta": "January 2, 2018", "paragraphs": ["Giorgio Armani will launch a flagship e-tail store on Tmall to sell its high-end cosmetic products in China, the company announced at the end of December last year.

As for consumers, the access to the Luxury Pavilion was\u00a0invitation-only, which means Alibaba had filtered out customers in advance based on their previous transactions on Taobao. The more one has spent on Taobao, the more likely one will be invited to the Luxury Pavilion.", "Therefore, even though joining Tmall may help Giorgio Armani expand its presence in China, the effort might be limited, given that such an e-tail store will only be available to select luxury consumers. Of course, differentiating individual shoppers is the best way to maximize profits and is in fact quite popular in the industry. But doesn\u2019t this also indicate routine profiling and discrimination from the retailer? Will it be a good policy in the long run?", "Western high-end cosmetics brands usually cost more in China due to import tariffs, and sometimes certain brands are not even available in local bricks-and-mortar stores, which forces many Chinese customers to turn to daigou (\u4ee3\u8d2d, shopping agents), who go abroad to buy goods to resell in China, for cheaper deals and purchases.", "By launching a flagship store on TMall, Giorgio Armani will make it easier for Chinese customers to order products directly from its authorized e-retail website \u2013 otherwise, these Chinese customers might step up their purchases through daigou in other countries or from other platforms. However, it\u2019s still not clear the pricing Giorgio Armani will offer to Tmall customers. If prices are not competitive compared to the price that a daigou can offer, customers may very well avoid using the platform.", "Despite e-commerce platforms\u2019 relentless efforts to fight against counterfeit goods, it is impossible to make each e-commerce site completely fake-free.

Look-alike goods are often hard to examine and can exist in all corners of the e-commerce world. For example, Kering, which owns brands including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, has filed law suits against Alibaba for allegedly selling counterfeit (note: not fake) goods on the platform.", "The post-90 generation, who have grown up and matured with mobile technology, is now a driving force for the online luxury purchase industry, according to the latest report on China\u2019s e-luxury market by Secoo and Tencent.

The risk is that online shoppers are less interested in a perfectly curated experience than a lower price they can find elsewhere.", "3. The Snob Strategy ", "One way to create an exclusive, high-end digital experience without building a site from scratch is to launch on a luxury e-tailer site, like Secoo\u00a0or Vip.com.", "Brands pursuing this strategy include Tod\u2019s on Secoo, Marc Jacobs on Vip.com, Loewe on Luxury Pavilion, and Saint Lauren on Toplife.", "Brands can sell directly to wealthy clientele, making it easier to accomplish a higher transaction rate. However, they also need to choose the platform wisely, testing the digital experience from start to finish and carefully selecting inventory that fit the platform. For example, Vip.com is known to offer deep discounts, while Secoo prides itself on providing a \u201cfive sense luxury experience\u201d with the offering of offline experience centers.", "4.

Examples include Tag Heuer, Coach, Burberry, and La Mer on Tmall, and Chopard, Zenith, Armani, and Swarovski on JD.com.", "This strategy can gain brands more exposure without requiring a large investment of resources. But these platforms are also considered mass-market and are filled with counterfeit items, diminishing luxury brands\u2019 exclusivity by association. In addition, the majority of consumers on these platforms are price-sensitive, requiring brands to deploy a discount strategy to capture their attention.", "5.

Pieces of that collection hit the brand\u2019s physical stores and online shops the following day.

Implications for supply chain, distribution, and marketing are among the key issues of the discussion.", "Aside from its pioneer Burberry, the model\u2019s early adapters included Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren, Thakoon Panichigul, and Kate Spade, among others. Three seasons in, the model yielded drastically different results for various brands. For instance, Tom Ford, Thakoon Panichigul, and Kate Spade abandoned the model after 2 seasons, citing reasons, ranging from shipping schedule conflicts to an incompatible retail environment. Meanwhile, Burberry and Ralph Lauren have continued with the model and have insisted it is working for them. However, market data has suggested that both brands are struggling, as far as sales numbers are concerned. In contrast, Tommy Hilfiger appears to have done pretty well, but the positive results seem to be at the expense of astronomically high costs for extravagant fashion shows, an army of big-name supermodels and performers, as well as lavish marketing and social media campaigns, in which very few luxury brands are financially able or willing to invest.", "By comparison, the \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 model seems to have fared much better in China than in the United States or Europe. Unlike their American or European counterparts, where luxury brands usually test out the \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 model on their own as individual brands, luxury brands in China (local or international alike) decided to take a different route. Brands in China began utilizing Alibaba\u2019s Tmall platform to participate in \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 fashion shows as a collective group last year, thanks to the annual Singles Day online shopping frenzy on November 11.

To further stoke the online frenzy and build consumer interest, seven major Chinese media platforms, including Youku, Weibo, and Taobao and Tmall\u2019s shopping apps, broadcast the live show on October 31.", "What sets China apart from its American and European counterparts, as far as the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model\u2019s results are concerned? The underlying factors are complicated, and one of them is related to the unique approach of having collective fashion shows, and leveraging the unparalleled financial, operational, and media backing of Alibaba. Another reason lies in consumer mentality. Shanghai-based China influencer marketing expert, Kim Leitzes, observed that the biggest difference between fashion brands experimenting with their own runway shows (such as most of those luxury brands in the United States and Europe) versus doing it through Tmall is the audience\u2019s intent to purchase. \u201cWhen a consumer watches a runway show, either onsite or online, the vast majority are not in the \u2018buy now\u2019 mode.

However, the impressive sales numbers from last year\u2019s show serve as a pretty good indicator of how things will turn out this year in for Singles Day. In the meantime, given the fact that this year\u2019s show managed to attract an unprecedented number of top international luxury brands, and that it was supported by seven of the major Chinese online platforms, there is reason to believe that it\u2019ll be another good year for Tmall\u2019s \u2018See Now, Buy Now\u2019 experiment this time around."]}, {"title": "What Commercial Real Estate Says About China\u2019s Next Luxury Gold Mine", "meta": "November 8, 2017", "paragraphs": ["China\u2019s luxury market has been recovering since the second half of last year, and luxury brands need to better identify potential growth markets to leverage this recovery.

It has\u00a0surpassed first-tier cities Guangzhou and Shenzhen in overall commercial real estate performance; becoming a fashion center in the western part of China.", "Several reasons cause luxury brands to highlight Chengdu in their expansion agenda. Chengdu is the most important city in southwestern China. Sichuan Province, whose capital is Chengdu, has a strong luxury consumer base.

Because of this, this year, the report downgrades the digital proficiency of these luxury brands operating in China by 9 percentage points from the previous year\u2019s level to just 46 percent.", "Digital proficiency by luxury brands operating in China has fallen to 46 percent from 55 percent in the previous year.", "The report names the British luxury powerhouse Burberry, followed by the American fashion brand Michael Kors and fine watch and jewelry maker\u00a0Cartier, as three outperformers. Burberry in China has fully harnessed all types of available digital channels. It has a Chinese official website that is highly localized for Chinese customers. It also has opened stores on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall, as well as launched an online boutique on WeChat. The brand has also made substantial efforts in offering high-quality customer service and style advisory through phone and social media channels, as well as integrating online and offline shopping experiences. Burberry\u2019s wide e-commerce footprint is in contrast with its rivals, such as Gucci, Prada, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton, which have not yet established any direct e-commerce.", "On the e-commerce front, the study also notes that, in general, Western luxury brands that are willing to sell through this channel tend to go to platforms such as JD.com, Secoo.com and 5lux.com, but keep away from launching flagship stores on Tmall and boutiques via WeChat. One explanation could be that many luxury brands still find it hard to work with Alibaba, as their businesses in China have all, to some extent, suffered from the counterfeit phenomenon on that platform.", "When it comes to the level of localization, Coach, Hugo Boss and Ray-Ban are leading, followed by Armani, Burberry, Cartier, Dior and Michael Kors. A high level of localization requires a brand to pay attention to things such as language and currency, and establish\u00a0official presence on major Chinese sites such as Baidu, WeChat, Weibo, and Youku. Meanwhile, local celebrities and fashion bloggers also play a significant role in helping to localize the brands. For example, Burberry has been working closely with Chinese singer and actor Kris Wu, while Cartier uses singer Lu Han to promote their products.", "The availability of \u201cstyle advisory\u201d is also used as a benchmark to measure brands\u2019 digital performance. Under this category, French fashion house Dior was named as having the best practice via offering an online chat service (in Chinese) to customers with product suggestions. Louis Vuitton offers a similar service via phone and SMS, while Brunello Cucinelli does it via email. Digitally savvy Michael Kors, Cartier and Burberry all provide the service through social media platforms, namely WeChat and Weibo.", "In addition, some brands have recognized the importance of mobile payments in the shopping process of Chinese customers. The study discovers that Alipay and cash on delivery have been widely enabled, while European brands, including Ferragamo, Chanel and Dior, also allow customers to pay via WeChat wallet.", "The integration of online and offline channels is still in the beginning stages in China, according to the report. To name two pioneers aside from Burberry, Bulgari allows customers to pick up items ordered on WeChat in store, and Coach offers online and in-store product exchange services.", "Overall, luxury brands in China still have a long way to go when it comes to fully taking advantage of opportunities in China\u2019s digital sphere. The authors of the report said, \u201cIt is less than ideal that digital luxury is still dominated by local champions,\u201d as those Western brands who currently have progress to make in their e-commerce presence need to keep in mind that the Chinese consumers they\u2019re looking to attract are \u201cyoung, tech savvy, and eager to embrace change.\u201d", "Update: The story has been corrected to show that Burberry has no official e-stores on JD.com, Secoo.com, or 5lux.com."]}, {"title": "Millennial 20/20 Summit: 4 Chinese Millennial Realities Luxury Brands Need to Know", "meta": "March 3, 2017", "paragraphs": ["Today, an increasing number of foreign brands in China are beginning to recognize the power of China\u2019s\u00a0millennials in determining the future of their businesses, and major luxury players, such as Burberry, Cartier, and Gucci, among others, have all recently made bold efforts to attract this demographic. Chinese millennials matter to luxury brands because of their large population and massive purchasing power.", "This demographic is made up of almost 415 million consumers, accounting for about 31 percent of the total population in China, according to a report published by Goldman Sachs in 2015. Their spending ability is expected to steadily increase thanks to the fact that\u00a0the unique social and cultural setting in China exempts this market from the pressures their Western counterparts usually have, including purchasing property and repaying student loans.", "To demystify the power of the millennial generation in China and around the globe in shaping the future of retail and media, more than 4,000 experts gathered at the \u201cMillennial 20/20 Summit\u201d March 1 and 2 in New York City . Many speakers whose expertise lies in helping\u00a0foreign brands break into China markets shared their insights on this unique demographic. Here are four takeaways from their speeches on how to sell products to Chinese millennials.", "1. Chinese millennials grew up in a rapidly changing economic and social environment.", "The word \u201cmillennial\u201d is not used as frequently in China as it is in the West. Instead, Chinese usually refer to the groups of people between 20 and 35 years old as \u201cpost-80s\u201d, \u201cpost-90s\u201d, or even \u201cpost-95s\u201d. This demographic was born right after China opened up, kicking off economic reform in\u00a01978. These generations have witnessed the dramatic transformation of the country from a closed and poor nation to now the world\u2019s second largest economy that has both benefited and suffered from globalization and economic integration. Many panelists, thus, said that living and growing up in such a rapidly changing economic and social environment gives Chinese millennials a number of unique characteristics. Even though the emergence of digital technologies have a huge impact on their purchasing decisions and consumer behaviors, the innate economic and social factors that shape their values and consumption culture cannot go unnoticed.", "2. Chinese millennials are the world\u2019s most ultra-connected consumers.", "Denise Sabet, the managing director at Labbrand, said at a session that she found \u201cChinese millennials want to be always online.\u201d Indeed, young people are extremely adept at making use of fragmented time to be online. Ranging from the morning/evening commute, bathroom breaks, to pre-sleep, the majority of Chinese millennials spend a significant amount of time checking their mobile phones. This represents a need for them to stay connected with the world through the internet and social media, and brands should consider how they can gain millennials\u2019\u00a0attention within such short and fragmented periods.", "3. Chinese millennials participate in a unique commercial ecosystem that is dominated by e-commerce.", "It is well known that nearly every digital product and service in the West, be it Facebook, Google, Airbnb, or Uber, has\u00a0a counterpart in China. This has made it harder for foreign brands to do businesses in China, but that is not the only challenge. A speaker from Hot Pot Digital, a China digital marketing firm, noted that unlike in the U.S., e-commerce entirely defines the business ecosystem in China, as it almost appears in every step of the consumption process of Chinese millennials. The company estimates that China will represent about 60 percent of all global e-commerce transactions by 2020.", "4. Chinese millennials are eager to be seen as global citizens.", "Brands should not ignore the eagerness of Chinese millennials to show friends and families their close connection to the rest of the world. The relevance of this fact to foreign brands is that young Chinese people are now increasingly enthusiastic about knowing and buying standout\u00a0and niche brands\u00a0that can demonstrate their one-of-a-kind\u00a0tastes and distinguish them from others. Sabet from Labbrand said\u00a0\u201ceducating Chinese millennials is still an important part for foreign brands that hope to succeed in China.\u201d"]}, {"title": "China\u2019s Daigou Shoppers Hit Fashion Weeks to Build Credibility With Clients", "meta": "February 28, 2017", "paragraphs": ["It is no longer surprising to see Chinese celebrities and fashion bloggers flocking to international fashion weeks, where\u00a0they\u00a0can improve their domestic reputation.

While this makes the lives of\u00a0daigou shoppers more difficult, the demand to purchase luxury goods overseas in order to exploit price differences is still high among Chinese luxury shoppers. With the anti-graft campaign, luxury brands\u2019 efforts to standardize\u00a0global pricing, and continuous doubts regarding the authenticity of their goods, the daigou circle is desperate to prove the value of its existence, as well as retain and nurture loyal customers.", "For daigou shoppers, attending fashion weeks around the world can add a layer of authenticity to their business. \u201cI can gain customers\u2019 trust and stand out among my competitors,\u201d one\u00a0daigou shopper, Xiaoling Tang\u00a0said.

She said that attending luxury brands\u2019 fashion shows is solid proof to her customers that what she buys for them is not counterfeit.", "For years, Chinese daigou\u00a0agents have had difficulties assuring their customers their products are authentic as counterfeit culture prevails in the industry. They have thus come up with various solutions, including live-streaming their shopping processes and sending back official receipts to their clients. Tang\u00a0said she did not feel comfortable revealing how she gained invitations to shows, but one\u00a0likely way she and other\u00a0daigou shoppers do so is by\u00a0buying large amount of products in the brands\u2019 stores so that they are officially invited to attend the shows as the top buyers of the year.", "The enthusiasm the daigou circle has for international fashion weeks is not solely due to the authenticity and professionalism these events can offer their business. They also can benefit from the \u2018see-now-buy-now\u2019 trend among luxury brands and Chinese consumers. Shanghai-based daigou agent Ruby Han has already begun promoting the Spring/Summer 2017 ready-to-wear collection that Burberry launched at London Fashion Week on her WeChat account. Her Chinese customers have already asked whether she could buy Burberry\u2019s latest products for them. \u201cWe need to act swiftly, otherwise, our competitors will get the deals,\u201d she said.", "A Shanghai-based daigou seller is promoting Burberry\u2019s spring collection at her customers\u2019 requests.", "Daigou shoppers\u2019 presence at international fashion weeks is a new trend, but \u201cis also a natural development,\u201d said Steve Dickinson, an attorney with Harris Bricken\u00a0and a regular contributor to China Law Blog. \u201cThe daigou started with serving customers in China who knew exactly what they wanted and were merely placing very specific orders. This moves beyond that, to providing information to Chinese customers, rather than just providing the products. That is, the Chinese customer is not relying on advertising from the luxury retailers, but are pushing out ahead of advertising to seize on the absolutely latest trend.\u201d", "Dickinson said\u00a0Han\u2019s role has gone far beyond her traditional responsibilities as a daigou seller, and instead she has become\u00a0an expert consultant for her clients on what is going on in the high fashion world.", "Han said\u00a0that even though some of her clients are already in tune with the newest and hottest luxury trends, the majority of them view her as an opinion leader.\u00a0\u201cI have joked with my [daigou]\u00a0partners that it [the\u00a0daigou\u00a0business] will become harder and harder if we do not have good fashion sense,\u201d she said.", "The rising popularity of international fashion weeks in the daigou circle may raise alarm bells for brands, as the existence of the market has long been a headache for luxury brands who want to gain control over their profits. Additionally, prioritizing daigou shoppers as VIP\u00a0customers who gain free passes to fashion weeks may mean brands have more complex realities to grapple with when it comes to customer relationship management.", "The immediate impact of this phenomenon is currently difficult\u00a0to measure, but Dickenson said it could also teach brands a thing or two about emerging, albeit very small, markets in China. \u201cThe Chinese individuals who are pushing ahead to the new and untested are a different group of buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not a replacement for the traditional group but perhaps an extension of that group.

Meanwhile, the number of choices of platforms is ever-increasing\u2014in addition to Tmall and Taobao, major players Sina Weibo, JD and a host of more niche services such as Inke, Bilibili, and Panda TV all offer live streaming experiences.", "However, as with any initiative tagged as the \u2018next big thing\u2019, there are lessons to be learned from the early adopters:", "1. Celebrity delivers engagement.", "Giving people the opportunity to watch a live event has proved to be an effective way of engaging an audience, but using KOLs and famous faces can have a significant effect on viewer numbers and post-event activity. As an example, Maybelline\u2019s Chinese brand ambassador Angelababy hosted a live broadcast on video sharing platform Meipai. Known as the \u2018Instagram of video\u2019 and with more than 100 million users, its impressive reach led to lipstick sales worth US$220,000 in total. And last year, global luxury fashion, beauty and lifestyle department store Lane Crawford featured leading fashion KOL Fil White (Yen Sze-po) in a live-streamed in-store designer event which saw viewings more than triple compared to their previous event that had no celebrity element.", "Home truth \u2014 It\u2019s clearly worth asking the right kind of celebrity/KOL to appear on your live streaming event. They bring their fans and followers with them, increasing exposure and opportunities for promotion. The most popular ones don\u2019t come cheap, but it\u2019s a worthwhile investment which pays off in increased engagement.", "2. Live can be exciting, but unpredictable.", "While there\u2019s nothing like live streaming for delivering a \u2018right here, right now\u2019 experience which has the power to at least drive engagement and at most increase sales, once the cameras start rolling, it\u2019s out of the broadcaster\u2019s control to a degree, which some brands may find uncomfortable. Like live TV, the fact that anything can happen adds to the excitement of an event, while simultaneously increasing the risk that it could all go horribly wrong at any point, as Kanye West found out to his cost at the live-streamed launch of Yeezy 4. There\u2019s no editing, nowhere to hide false starts or mishaps\u2014luxury brands which like to be tightly in control of their image may find the prospect to be too much, though there is evidence to suggest that audiences are very forgiving of live mistakes as it all adds to their authenticity.", "Home truth \u2014 The best live events are backed by a lot of planning\u2014when you can\u2019t control or edit the output, it\u2019s absolutely essential to plan to control every element you can of the event itself. That means carrying out a risk assessment on even the minutest details, from weather predictions to what else might be scheduled viewing for that day, and having a backup plan for every eventuality. It\u2019s important to choose the right platform, too\u2014Tmall is geared up for people who want to \u2018see now, buy now\u2019, for example, while Bilibili, with its audience of anime, manga and gaming fans, is better for more creative projects.", "3. Live streaming is the one place where less is not more.", "In a world where brevity is the norm when it comes to getting the message across, live streaming is one of the few formats where long content is still very welcome. According to digital video analysts Visible Measures, on-demand promotional video clips tend to lose 20 percent of viewers in the first 10 seconds. But, if the build-up has been handled properly, live-stream viewers have already invested time and effort in getting ready for the event, and are prepared to give an average of 30 minutes to an hour to the experience. It\u2019s like going to a gig or performance\u2014if it\u2019s happening live, the audience wants to be there for it all. In an extreme example of audience endurance, Xiaomi showcased the battery life of its Mi Max phablet with a live stream that lasted 19 days, when the battery finally ran out.

And for those who missed out, engagement should be augmented by post-event video on demand, to cover all viewing preferences.", "4. Get the audience involved with interactivity.", "Live-streamed events can be engaging enough in their own right, particularly if they\u2019re linked to an exclusive launch or catwalk show. But smaller, more brand-based events can become significantly more interesting to the audience if they are able to interact with what\u2019s happening in real time. From showing viewers\u2019 live tweets to more creative projects, such as Adidas\u2019 ZX Flux live stream where a graffiti artist changed his patterns and designs based on viewer requests, involving the audience is a powerful way to keep their attention.", "Home truth \u2014 Sometimes it takes more than just showcasing a product. Live streaming is an ideal medium for innovation and creativity when it comes to audience involvement\u2014at the very least, viewers should be able to \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 as mentioned above.", "5. Rules and regulations", "While there is audience and appetite for live streaming in Asia, inevitably there will be restrictions on what can and can\u2019t be broadcast. China in particular has seen the introduction of a series of regulations since November of last year, which are designed to control output and monitor activity.

Brands that are more in tune with this trend are adopting mobile communications services as part of their purchasing experience. This is apparent with China\u2019s major e-commerce giants, who use WeChat and SMS to message shoppers purchase confirmations and returns information.", "The monobrands in the study, meanwhile, still heavily use email as a primary form of communication, all requiring shoppers to supply their email address for logging\u00a0in to make a purchase. Burberry, for example, while having \u201cthe most complete set of communications,\u201d does every step via email, aside from a phone call before delivery. In contrast, JD.com also has a similar in-depth communications strategy, but all steps are conducted via SMS and phone calls.", "When it comes to the ordering itself, Chinese consumers have different expectations than online shoppers in the West: They expect the delivery to arrive in under two days and returns to be free.

This was particularly true among women. About 6 percent of those surveyed were likely to give travel vouchers as gifts to women, just ahead of watches and electronics. As far as the types of gifts men were likely to receive, travel vouchers were low on the top 10 list, behind products like wine, electronics, and imported spirits.", "When it comes to paying for luxury goods, the Hurun report revealed that AliPay is the number one method of payment.

But while other major retail brands, including luxury fashion houses, have recently began offering WeChat Pay to their increasingly cash-free customers, Starbucks has been a little late to the game. Finally, earlier this month, Starbucks announced that not only would it be allowing consumers to pay for their coffee by scanning their WeChat QR code in stores, but that next year, it would be offering \u201csocial gifting,\u201d meaning China\u2019s WeChat users could send their friends vouchers for Starbucks without even going into the store.", "Gift options will include not only coffee vouchers, but branded products, which customers can send their WeChat friends with a personalized message.

A couple of differences include Snow\u2019s ability to let the user create a GIF to send in a message, share a video, and photo filters, which are a particularly coveted feature for Chinese users. Snapchat, like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, is blocked in China, so it\u2019s not really uncommon to find copycats (China\u2019s Weibo has been compared to Twitter, while social network Renren has\u00a0similarities to Facebook).", "Possibly to take extra precaution against also getting blocked in China, Snow recently released an app specifically for the China market without its \u201cstory\u201d function, or the in-app messaging capabilities that, like Snapchat, are only visible for 24 hours after posting. China\u2019s version of Snow instead lets users connect the app with their WeChat accounts, meaning they can only send photos, GIFs and video created on Snow through WeChat.

Highlights include the finding that over the past year, 80 percent of mainland China\u2019s online fashion consumption has been through the Tmall platform, where brands are increasingly launching new product lines between 15-30 days ahead of offline release.

With such a wide range of brands now represented on the platform, critics argue that Tmall may not be able to address the primary values and ambition of luxury retailers that maintain their high-end status through a degree of exclusivity and personalized \u201cVIP\u201d service.", "Tmall also continues to face criticism for its response to third-party sellers of counterfeit and gray-market goods on the site, with an L2 report showing that prior to Coach\u2019s departure from the platform, only 12 percent of the first-page results for Coach were from the official store. Burberry, however, seems to be reaping the rewards of an official store on Tmall, with Alibaba successfully clamping down on removing all fake and gray-market Burberry items. ", "Tmall\u2019s continuous struggle with exclusivity vs. mass availability still causes luxury brands to question whether it is possible to maintain a high level of quality in such a huge open marketplace. Ultimately, this concern may be the primary reason why more luxury brands have yet to jump at the chance to sign on to Tmall\u2019s growing platform. There is certainly a market for big buyers, with brands like Maserati unveiling huge rewards schemes for the 11.11 festival this year, but the presence of unofficial third-party sellers of luxury brands will continue to cause companies to feel uneasy about being thrown in with this pick and mix of quality.

The recent Luxury Interactive conference in New York from October 17 to 19 addressed this topic with panels and talks on the latest technological developments in the luxury industry, from experimenting with new online sales channels to adapting brick-and-mortar stores to the connected shopper. ", "Naturally, a big part of the conversation involved one of the world\u2019s most important and digitally savvy groups of luxury customers: Chinese shoppers. Below are six key takeaways from the conference on pursuing China luxury sales and marketing strategies for the digital world. ", "\u201cDig deep in the trenches\u201d of influencers to reach China\u2019s millennials.", "According to speaker Nancy Zhang, the COO of multi-brand luxury retailer Otte New York, finding the right social media influencers in China means having in-depth knowledge of which fashion bloggers are truly resonating with a younger consumer base. The right influencer can be useful not only for major labels, but also for niche luxury brands and retailers to gain significant visibility and cachet. ", "The reach of China\u2019s top fashion influencers may not be immediately apparent, as their content often differs not only from that of a major fashion magazine, but also from their U.S. counterparts. For example, Zhang discussed the example of fashion blogger Gogoboi, one of the top fashion bloggers on WeChat. He has a \u201cvery unique approach to fashion,\u201d she said, noting that he once spent an entire month matching outfits to Pokemon characters. Also known for his acerbic wit and sharp critiques, \u201che\u2019s basically like Joan Rivers\u201d in the Chinese fashion world. This blogging style has been a hit with attracting fans and brands alike, as he\u2019s been sponsored by brands like Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, and Bulgari.

Her main strategy to build up this audience revolved around developing a specific voice on Chinese-language social media, which included \u201cnot doing marketing, but being their friends.\u201d For example, the company was the first enterprise in the United States to include travel advice on its Weibo account, and she considers her company\u2019s 5 million Weibo followers to be part of a \u201cshopping community.\u201d", "Even though the site is based in the United States, U.S.-based Chinese users offer a direct line to China with a big influence on their contacts living there. \u201cThis audience can teach their family and friends about how to shop from this site,\u201d she said.", "Define a flagship luxury experience online.", "Another important strategy for China outlined by Zhang was the concept of the digital \u201cflagship luxury experience\u201d to create a sense of exclusivity online when it comes to both browsing for information and shopping. While many heritage luxury brands are worried that e-commerce may not create a high-end experience, it is crucial for smaller niche retailers who \u201ccannot rely on opening giant black flagship stores,\u201d she said. As Chinese shoppers\u2019 top travel destinations are constantly changing, reaching them online through clear promotion strategies\u2014and sales and distribution if e-commerce is involved\u2014is key.", "Embrace a \u201cphygital\u201d future when it comes to retail.", "In addition to e-commerce, brands\u2019 brick-and-mortar shops are now a crucial platform to employ a digital strategy, whether they\u2019re aware of it or not, according to Euromonitor International Senior Analyst Ayako Homma. She called this strategy \u201cphygital,\u201d or a combination of digital and physical. She cited examples of \u201cretail theater\u201d such as Burberry\u2019s \u201cmagic mirrors\u201d in fitting rooms, which scan products and transform into a video screen with a clip from the product in a runway show, and Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s in-store virtual reality headsets that allow shoppers to watch fashion shows. Meanwhile, Sephora has enacted a \u201cteach, inspire, and play\u201d (TIP) plan for stores. She noted that these technological developments are especially important in emerging markets like China, which Euromonitor considers to be home to comparatively digitally focused luxury consumers\u2014for example, she stated that emerging market consumers have a higher rate of purchasing via social media such as WeChat. ", "Develop a tailored social commerce strategy. ", "\u201cSocial commerce really does allow the user to drive their brand discovery,\u201d said Zhang, who recommended that brands need to carefully examine top Chinese platforms like Tmall, JD.com, Red, and Mogujie to see if any fit with their identity. \u201cThey\u2019re able to target a much more specific sector of the retail world\u2014in the millennial market\u2014and really speak a very specific language to them and give them specific products that match their identity.\u201d Her company decided to sign on with social e-commerce app Red and works with it on a weekly basis.

The firm found in its post-Brexit study that a Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 bag would set a shopper back US$1,115 in China, but only costs $802 in the UK, $850 in France, and $970 in the United States. Meanwhile, a Balenciaga Foulard Fringe dress is now $1,312 in the UK, making it $353 less than the China cost, and a Brunello Cucinelli cashmere sweater is $808 in the UK, compared to $1,287 in China and $995 in the United States.", "Luxury brands have long been grappling with the gray market in China created by the significantly higher cost of imported goods brought on by tariffs. Many have adjusted their prices in China to harmonize them with the global average, including Chanel, Cartier, Burberry, Patek Philippe, TAG Heuer, and Louis Vuitton. In some cases, this means that prices in China can even be a better deal\u2014the Balenciaga dress mentioned earlier is actually $100 more expensive in the United States than in China, for example. But overall, Chinese luxury consumers are still stuck with high costs at home\u2014only 29 percent of luxury brands have an average China price of their goods that is within 15 percent of their global price, according to a 2016 report by L2, which found that Burberry is 37 percent more expensive on average, while Louis Vuitton is 25 percent more. Surprisingly, \u201caccessible luxury\u201d labels are even more likely than the most high-end brands to have a China price gap as they try to make up for low margins abroad and position themselves as higher-end in China than they do in other countries such as the United States.", "Abrupt currency fluctuations are especially challenging to luxury brands, which are often loathe to lower prices in the middle of a season for fear that it will come across that they are \u201cdiscounting\u201d items. When price adjustments do occur, they\u2019re generally done with new collections rather than items already on the shelves. Chanel\u2019s 2015 mid-season price cuts were an exception, and proved why high-end brands are so protective of their images: lines formed outside of Chanel\u2019s China stores after the cuts and rumors swirled on WeChat that the brand was having a \u201csale.\u201d A Brunello Cucinelli representative recently told Wall Street Journal\u00a0that its own price adjustments due to currency are made at the start of each collection.", "In addition to brands, China\u2019s government has also had an incentive to try to reduce daigou sales due to the fact that it\u2019s lost out on a significant amount of tax revenue due to the gray market. It\u2019s undertaken a string of recent tax cuts, including 2015 cuts on imports and this month\u2019s cosmetics tax cuts, as well as an April 2016 tax hike on items ordered online from abroad and items brought into the country worth more than RMB5,000. The government has also slowly been allowing more duty-free expansion, with recent openings of duty-free malls in downtown Shanghai and Hainan.", "The luxury gray market in China has been shrinking as a result of these changes, but it\u2019s still significant. According to Bain & Company, it decreased to RMB43 billion in 2015, down from an estimated RMB55 to 75 billion in 2014.

When a brand is hot, these backstage influencers are favored advocates. But when the sparkle dims, the negative messaging calls for damage control.

It\u2019s a customizable product allowing travelers to connect with brands the moment they walk into stores, not unlike the Zurich airport model. Cicerone automatically brings visitors to a brand\u2019s WeChat account where they become a follower, and the app delivers a personalized welcome and highlights customer services. It also serves targeted promotions, tracks loyalty rewards and can allow for preorders and purchases before a tourist arrives.

Below are some of the main reasons that Sephora and Luxottica likely decided to partner with JD.com.", "Greater market reach.\u00a0While Sephora has been serious about developing online sales in China with extensive social marketing and e-commerce loyalty programs, there\u2019s just no way to beat the e-commerce market share of major platforms like JD.com. According to statistics from 2014, JD.com\u00a0accounted for almost one-fourth\u00a0of all B2C sales in China.", "WeChat e-commerce capabilities.\u00a0Although Tmall has a much higher B2C market share than JD.com in China\u2014making up about half of all sales last year, JD.com has a major advantage over Alibaba: WeChat sales. That\u2019s because WeChat owner Tencent is Alibaba\u2019s main competitor, and has partnered with JD to allow in-app sales through the platform. Brands promoting their Tmall shops on WeChat are unable to do so, as WeChat banned links to\u00a0Alibaba sites last year.", "A robust logistics network.\u00a0Logistics remain a challenge for brands looking to develop their e-commerce networks in China. Like Alibaba, JD.com has developed a robust logistics network with tens of thousands of delivery workers and thousands of delivery stations across the country, which Sephora and Luxottica can now leverage.", "Protection against the gray market.\u00a0China\u2019s\u00a0online gray market\u00a0causes major headaches for global luxury brands. Sales of foreign goods bought abroad and smuggled in to avoid China\u2019s high tariffs are rampant on the country\u2019s e-commerce platforms. Even worse, counterfeit goods being passed off as the real thing are becoming a major problem on these sites. By signing up with a major e-commerce platform, brands are in a better position to get gray-market items and fakes removed.", "Since Sephora and Luxottica both sell comparatively accessible luxury goods\u2014cosmetics and sunglasses\u2014it\u2019s a no-brainer that they\u2019d sign up for one of China\u2019s major platforms. Most international cosmetics brands have fully embraced these mass-market websites to reach China\u2019s middle-class shoppers. The key for both JD.com and Tmall in the near future will be convincing more major fashion brands like Burberry that their brand identities won\u2019t take a hit if they follow suit.", "\u00a0", "E-Commerce, Tech", "china, china e-commerce, china luxury, cosmetics, e-commerce, JD.com, luxottica, Luxury, sephora, tmall, wechat"]}, {"title": "Quality Trumps Price for China\u2019s Savvy Online Shoppers", "meta": "May 10, 2015", "paragraphs": ["Burberry\u2019s Tmall shop.", "This article was published earlier in our weekly newsletter.

Now, the most important things for these consumers are quality and authenticity.", "A new report released this week by iResearch finds that quality is the most influential factor driving Chinese consumers\u2019\u00a0online\u00a0shopping\u00a0behavior, according to 47.7 percent of survey respondents. Product authenticity is now a concern for 91 percent of Chinese online\u00a0shoppers\u00a0from 15 different cities, according to a different report by the consultancy RedTech Advisors. This is compared to just 78 percent of respondents saying the same a year ago, showing that the authenticity trend is growing.", "These results coincide with earlier data indicating that fewer Chinese consumers are willing to purchase fakes\u00a0online. In February, a survey by Tencent found that 58.2 percent of those who bought counterfeits\u00a0online\u00a0only did so because they were scammed by unsavory\u00a0online\u00a0sellers\u2014not because they set out in search of inexpensive counterfeits.", "That said, price is still a major factor. iResearch found that price was the second biggest influencer for\u00a0online\u00a0buyers, identified by 46.9 percent of respondents. However, a growing mistrust of the authenticity of gray-market goods could mean that more consumers will avoid random Taobao merchants in the future, instead opting for more trustworthy platforms. Indeed, iResearch finds that \u201cwebsite account safety\u201d and \u201cwebsite reputation\u201d are the third and fourth most important factors influencing China\u2019s\u00a0online\u00a0shoppers.", "The main takeaway for luxury brands (especially those that have avoided an official e-commerce presence in China) is that China\u2019s e-commerce market is not necessarily one giant bargain basement that will automatically lower brand prestige, if approached in the right way. When considering strategies for the Chinese e-commerce market, whether luxury e-boutiques or mass-market platforms like Tmall, brands need to weigh the costs and benefits of providing authenticity-focused customers an\u00a0online\u00a0buying alternative to the scammers and gray-market sellers."]}, {"title": "From \u2018About\u2019 China to \u2018For\u2019 China: Met\u2019s New Fashion Exhibit Marks End of Orientalist Era for Western Designers", "meta": "April 29, 2015", "paragraphs": ["A China-exclusive dress created by Valentino and presented in Shanghai in 2013 that will be on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute\u2019s \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass\u201d Exhibit.

That might be due less to a political correctness wave, however, and more to economics. Now that Chinese shoppers are the top customer base for most of the brands on display at the exhibit, designers must focus on creating clothes for China, not just about China.", "The new exhibit that kicks off with the glamorous annual Costume Institute Benefit (or \u201cMet Gala\u201d) on May 4 may have \u201cChina\u201d in the name, but it\u2019s \u201cnot about China per se,\u201d said curator Andrew Bolton in a recent Women\u2019s Wear Daily article. Rather, it\u2019s mainly about the way Western designers interpret Chinese culture, or \u201ca China that exists as a collective fantasy.\u201d\u00a0As the Met points out in its description of the event, much of this fantasy was driven by classic films set in 1920s, 30s, and 40s China\u2014and these often had highly problematic themes. For example, Suzie Wong\u00a0 is commonly criticized for racism and sexism,\u00a0while films starring famous Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong often portrayed her as either a \u201cpainted doll\u201d or a \u201cscheming dragon lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "An evening gown by Roberto Cavalli based on Chinese porcelain that will be on display at the Costume Institute\u2019s new exhibit, \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass.\u201d (Metropolitan Museum of Art)", "While many of the dresses being displayed don\u2019t go full-on \u201cdragon lady\u201d and often just take inspiration from films actually by Chinese directors or from Chinese artwork, most of the ones revealed so far do represent the sartorial equivalent of Orientalism, a term which historically referred to the study of a broad swath of territory referred to as the \u201cOrient,\u201d including Asia and the Middle East. When professor Edward Said published his groundbreaking book Orientalism in 1978, he pointed out the problematic side of works of art or literature deemed \u201cOrientalist,\u201d noting that they often relied on patronizing racial stereotypes of \u201cexotic\u201d or \u201cmystical\u201d \u201cEastern\u201d cultures that often portrayed them as static and backward. According to Said, Orientalism was out of touch with on-the-ground realities in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, despite being part and parcel of Europe\u2019s colonial enterprises in those places. In a recent interview with Vogue, Bolton agreed that many of the dresses on display at the exhibition fit the rubric of Orientalism, but he argues this isn\u2019t a negative when it comes to fashion because it represents \u201can exchange of ideas and an honored source of influence.\u201d", "For the fashion designers with pieces on display, it will ultimately be wealthy Chinese consumers who make the final judgment call on this issue\u2014with their wallets. Even if certain designs with Chinese elements don\u2019t come across as offensive, they won\u2019t resonate with consumers if they show a lack of understanding of Chinese culture. China can no longer exist just in fashion labels\u2019 fantasies if they want to stay in business, and the perception that a garment is culturally tone-deaf will now lead directly to decreased profits. Over the past decade, Chinese luxury spending has grown tenfold and represented 30 percent of the global luxury market in 2014, according to Altagamma and Bain. This has been a rapid and groundbreaking change, since they accounted for only 3 percent only 10 years earlier (a time when many of the dresses at the exhibit were created). That number is just the average, and is much higher for some fashion brands\u2014Chinese consumers make up 38 percent of Prada\u2019s customer base, 37 percent of Gucci\u2019s, and 35 percent of Bottega Veneta\u2019s and Burberry\u2019s, according to estimates from Exane BNP Paribas.", "Designers have already become acutely aware of this shift, and the exhibit itself makes this clear. For example, it features a 2013 dress created by Valentino as part of an 85-piece capsule collection exclusively for the China market, which was presented in a special Shanghai runway show. Rather than featuring outfits that looked like they belong on the set of a culturally insensitive 1960\u2019s movie about 1920\u2019s-era Shanghai, the collection gave a nod to Chinese aesthetics with a red color palette while presenting pieces that were realistically wearable by the average urban Chinese fashionista.", "In a recent interview with Bolton published in Vogue, designer John Galliano noted that he has made this shift consciously since he began including Chinese motifs in his designs decade ago. \u201cI was fascinated with the culture. In retrospect, I think it was because I knew very little about it. Before I visited China, it was the fantasy that drew me to it, the sense of danger and mystery conveyed through Hollywood,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cmuch later, I learned more about the real China through research\u2014paintings, literature, architecture. My design process involves in-depth research, and I make a scrapbook for every collection with images that show my current thinking.

The Costume Institute is also teaming up with the museum\u2019s Department of Asian Art in order to juxtapose the designers\u2019 creations with the original Chinese garments, paintings, porcelains, and art that inspired them.", "The mass public perception of the exhibition will be shaped in large part by the images that emerge from the Met Gala itself, which has designated a \u201cChinese white tie\u201d dress code\u00a0and is causing speculation that confused celebrities may show up in culturally insensitive attire. If celebrities and the designers they\u2019re wearing receive criticism, it will affect their standing not only in the United States, but in the China market as well.", "Visitors to the exhibition who want to see the what the new face of Chinese fashion looks like need to only travel a few blocks away to Barney\u2019s, which is selling a special-edition capsule collection by China-born, London-based designer Huishan Zhang to celebrate the exhibit.

In 2014, it saw 32 percent growth in the fourth quarter that contributed to an overall 18 percent growth rate for 2014.\u00a0", "The sharp upturn in spending is due to several key factors, with the most obvious being the widened price gap between luxury goods in mainland China and Europe thanks to the weakening euro. While the high \u201cChina price\u201d of luxury goods has been driving shoppers abroad for years\u2014experts estimate that between 70 and 76 percent of luxury goods purchased by Chinese consumers are bought outside the mainland\u2014recent currency fluctuations have meant that some items can be 70 percent more expensive in China than in Europe. Some brands have taken extreme measures to address the issue: Chanel, Tag Heuer, Cartier, and Patek Phillippe have lowered their China prices, while Burberry is considering the same policy.", "The soaring growth isn\u2019t necessarily all good for luxury brands. While many of these sales are likely thanks to price-savvy Chinese tourists buying for themselves, friends, or family, a significant proportion is also likely going to gray-market daigou sellers\u00a0who plan to smuggle the goods past customs and list on Taobao or WeChat. Although the gray market still boosts short-term sales for brands, it has many downsides\u2014unauthorized sellers may hurt brand perception, and quality after-sales service isn\u2019t available to buyers. In addition, many online shops purporting to be selling genuine daigou goods are actually just hawking very expensive fakes.\u00a0 ", "Another big cause for the rise of international sales is the decline of Hong Kong as a luxury shopping destination for mainlanders in the wake of political upheaval and anti-mainland protests at popular shopping centers. While it\u2019s convenient for mainlanders to travel to Hong Kong to shop, many who wish to stay within Asia are increasingly willing to head to South Korea and Japan to avoid disruptions and seek lower prices, while experienced travelers are venturing further afield to the United States and Europe\u2014especially now that the euro is creating such favorable prices.

Last year, C\u00e9line, Gucci, Fendi, Furla, and Hugo Boss\u00a0were among the labels that created special envelopes.", "Chinese traditions can also take place in the digital realm as brands create Chinese New Year marketing campaigns on social media.

It even\u00a0accused some luxury auto brands of cheating customers\u00a0by imposing high prices and blaming tariff rates this year. Chinese officials have shown some concessions in order to keep luxury shoppers in China: they allowed the world\u2019s largest duty-free mall to open in Hainan this year.

In many cases, change comes slowly as e-commerce is seen as a high risk for brands with long legacies to protect.", "Meanwhile, most of the brands that are willing to take the dive into e-tailing in China are still fearful of losing clout with their consumers.

Now that we\u2019re in November 2014, two years later, it\u2019s fair to consider that the bulk of the clean-out is broadly behind us and there are even signs of a slight pick-up in watch demand in China now as growth has become the reflection of true underlying sales driven by personal gifting and self-purchasing, not corporate gifting.

The usage is not the same, practices are not the same, but in the end, it impacts more the tactics and the implementation than the nature of the service. It is similar for other digital marketing activities\u2014for example, SEO follows the same principles in theory, but practically speaking, a lot of things differ.", "Another thing that is different here is that in the end, even if e-commerce is a reality for luxury brands, the fact is many are not ready to operate their own e-commerce platform here.

Ideally, you want to do both, but not every KOL is relevant for this. On the other hand, it\u2019s less and less impactful because audiences are more skeptical about the authenticity of messages. It doesn\u2019t make KOLs less relevant, just more challenging to work with and get a good return on investment. So it\u2019s important to pick the right KOLs, ones who have credibility and a relevant position for the brand. It\u2019s more important than before to be careful when selecting them. The audience is very aware of how it works. If it\u2019s simply to ask them to share content such write something based on a press release, it\u2019s not impactful anymore.

Of course, in China, there is a strong concept of tradition, heritage, and culture, but applying that to a commercial enterprise is a concept that is very new. I believe that is one reason.

The other tough challenge is to concretely face the fact that a lot of your assets are not relevant in China.", "However, luxury brands realized quite fast that our goal was not to apply a Western recipe to the Chinese market, but more to leverage on our understanding of our clients and their industries in order to build and conceive relevant digital marketing operations.

High taxes in mainland China mean instant savings once Chinese borders are crossed, but the outbound Chinese shopper expects even more. They expect to receive special treatment\u2014which generally translates to discounts, an uncomfortable prospect for luxury houses that see the \u201cdiscount\u201d as a four-letter word. This, however, has been influenced by the way luxury brands have courted Chinese consumers within mainland China since many entered the market.

Short of a double-digit discount, how can luxury brands or retailers offer this face-gaining experience? One way is by understanding the Chinese luxury buyer\u2019s second-favorite perk: the gift with purchase.

Alternately, brands can offer attractive gifts with purchase of featured items or bundles\u2014a popular target for tour group attendees in a hurry. Gift cards offered once shoppers hit a particular minimum spend (\u201cSpend X, get Y in gift cards\u201d) are another proven strategy, as well as discounts after minimum spend (\u201cSpend X, get Y off\u201d).

The billionaire or their representatives may provide insight on the net worth calculation.\u201d", "Combined, the lists reveal some interesting trends:", "Some experts suggest that these lists don\u2019t completely reflect the level of wealth in China. According to a study by Chinese economist Wang Xiaolu, Chinese households have much more income than official data suggests. The third edition of Wang\u2019s Chinese Grey Income study, which was published last month, found that when it comes to the top 10 percent of households, per capita income should be 3.2 times higher than the National Bureau of Statistics suggests.", "That finding was echoed by Credit Suisse analyst Rogerio Fujimori, who noted that the understatement of total income for higher earners in China is even more pronounced than the average gap of two-times for all Chinese householders, with big implications for luxury brands. \u201cThe Chinese official household income data substantially understates the income of top earners and hence the spending power of the target clientele of luxury goods brands in China,\u201d Fujimori writes. \u201cWith official statistics significantly under-estimating the spending power of the target clientele of luxury goods brands in China, the high level of Chinese luxury consumption looks likely sustainable given the \u2018subsidy\u2019 from grey income.\u201d", "Credit Suisse\u2019s 2013 Global Wealth Report found that China accounted for 9 percent, or $22 trillion, of global wealth in 2013, as well as 4 percent, or more than one million, of the world\u2019s population of millionaires. Credit Suisse estimates that Chinese spending accounts for as much as 30 percent of global sales for luxury brands. Fujimori said Burberry Group, Swatch Group, Prada, Tiffany and Chow Tai Fook were all especially well-positioned in China."]}, {"title": "Who Are The Winners In China\u2019s Luxury Slowdown?", "meta": "November 4, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Chinese model Fei Fei Sun on the Bottega Veneta S/S 2014 runway. (WWD)", "Recent data strongly suggests that China\u2019s luxury market is still in slowdown mode, but while some companies are seeing a strong slump, a clear set of winners is making it through 2013 with solid sales.", "Now in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s no doubt that year-end growth rates in China\u2019s luxury industry aren\u2019t going to rebound to anything close to pre-slowdown numbers. A study released last week by Bain & Company predicted that 2013 luxury sales in China would grow by only 2.5 percent to 15.3 billion euros. There\u2019s speculation that the slowdown may be long-term, as well: a recent luxury CEO survey by Departures and Ledbury found that executives are more confident about the North American luxury market than about East Asia as a driver of growth over the next five years, and former Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts said on-record last month that slowing luxury growth rates are \u201cthe new normal\u201d for the industry.", "When taking a look at individual brands, however, the slowdown rate is highly uneven, continuing a trend that has been going on all year. When it comes to fashion, \u201cmega-labels\u201d were not able to rebound from a first-half sales slump as they had hoped: Louis Vuitton experienced 5 percent growth, a number in line with the first half of the year, while Gucci saw \u201clow single-digit\u201d decline in China. It is likely that a main reason for the lagging growth has been Chinese consumers\u2019 growing sophistication and shifting preferences away from logo-heavy designs, as these brands have made efforts to increase their number of logo-free products and worked to avoid overexposure.", "This growing sophistication is emphasized in the fact that smaller niche labels as well as \u201cmasstige\u201d brands have fared significantly better in both the third quarter and the previous first half of the year. While Kering did not earn much revenue from Gucci, its smaller brands posted double-digit Greater China growth for the third quarter, with Bottega Veneta bringing in 30 percent and Stella McCartney,\u00a0Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and others collectively averaging 14 percent growth. Meanwhile, the more affordable \u201cmasstige\u201d category has also seen success, as Coach saw a 35 percent jump in sales for the third quarter.", "These substantial growth numbers are taking place because Chinese consumers are buying these products for themselves or for family and friends\u2014not for corrupt \u201cgifting\u201d purposes. As a continued stream of new anti-corruption efforts demonstrates, Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-graft crackdown is also still in high gear, and hitting many luxury sectors most associated with corruption or ostentatious displays of wealth that have been getting officials in trouble. For example, Swiss watch exports to China continue to decline, high-end liquor sales are still slumping, flashy car companies such as Ferrari and Lamborghini are seeing lower sales, and banquet foods such as shark-fin soup are in trouble.", "This downturn contrasts sharply with the aforementioned growth of successful fashion brands, as well as that of other consumer-oriented sectors such as beauty and mass luxury cars. Although LVMH was disappointed in its Louis Vuitton numbers, it said growth was strong in China for BeneFit cosmetics and Sephora sales. Meanwhile, China\u2019s wealthy apparently aren\u2019t worried about being too ostentatious if they drive an Audi or a BMW, as Volkswagen\u2019s China sales rose 18 percent from the beginning of the year until September, and BMW\u2019s grew by 20.8 percent.", "The bottom line for the luxury sector is that the numbers show that even if China\u2019s slowdown is long-term, brands with the right marketing strategies and an understanding of Chinese luxury consumers can still experience solid growth. According to the recent Departures/Ledbury survey, the Chinese growth rate was the third-highest factor in cause for optimism about the global luxury market. Additionally, luxury CEOs recognize that China\u2019s expected GDP growth rate of 7.5 percent is still comparably high, and previously skyrocketing rates merely reflected unsustainable numbers.", "In addition, companies worried about China growth should take a look at the global picture: Chinese customers may not be buying as much luxury at home, but they\u2019re certainly spending it abroad as the world\u2019s largest-spending bloc of tourists. As a result, brands must focus on the Chinese consumer on an international level in order to truly cash in on the market\u2019s high long-term growth potential."]}, {"title": "How LVMH Adapts To China\u2019s Evolving Luxury Market", "meta": "October 21, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Chinese model Liu Wen in an ad for Louis Vuitton\u2019s Les Foulards D\u2019Artistes artist scarf design collaboration.

Its shares have risen only \u201cmarginally\u201d higher since the beginning of 2013, while Cartier, Richemont, Burberry, and Kering have all seen shares rise by 20 percent.", "One main reason for this is that a Chinese shift away from ostentatious logos, fueled by both the corruption crackdown as well as a shift in global trends, dented LVMH\u2019s cash cow Louis Vuitton, which is known for its bags emblazoned with its iconic \u201cLV\u201d emblem.", "The company has been making numerous efforts to respond to this issue. One main strategy has been to cut down on promoting its classic logo-printed leather goods, instead opting to advertise its low-key products, as was apparent in a recent Beijing store opening in which celebrity ambassadors showed up clad head-to-toe in LV, but with very few logos in sight.", "This isn\u2019t the only move LVMH has made to respond to this issue in recent months, however. In fact, it has undertaken several additional strategies in the China market to reassert its exclusive brand image in China\u2019s changing luxury landscape. Below is a list of some of its new strategies this year:", "Cracking down on fakes", "One major problem facing Louis Vuitton is the prevalence of fake bags readily available in China, which may have contributed to diluting the brand\u2019s image. In order to combat this problem head-on, the company has signed an agreement with Alibaba\u00a0to prevent the sale of counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags on its Taobao e-commerce site.

I personally love the vintage style very much,\u201d said Fan at LV\u2019s Beijing opening.", "Adding a fresh face", "Although Fan has done a great deal of work for Louis Vuitton as a brand ambassador, the company has not used her as its sole representative in China, where some believe she may convey more of a mass-market than a luxury image.

Recent trends indicate that\u00a0Chinese\u00a0families have more money to spend on education and are more concerned with ensuring their child\u2019s success rate at getting into university. This has caused the average testing age for the TOEFL exam to drop, and China Daily reported that last year, the number of those under 18 taking the language test rose by 30 percent. There are also an increasing number of students enrolling in foundation or summer language courses prior to university to guarantee entry. We spoke to 19-year-old Wendy to find out what it\u2019s really like to study in London.", "Where are you from in\u00a0China?", "I am from Tongzhou in Beijing.", "When did you move to the UK and why?", "I moved to London on the 25th\u00a0of August 2012 to start my foundation course at Central Saint Martins. I chose to do the Foundation Diploma in Art and Design in order to prepare me for the undergraduate degree, improve my English, and guarantee entry. I am just about to start my undergraduate degree at Central Saint Martins in Product Design.", "Will you plan to stay in London once you graduate?", "For the moment, I plan to return to\u00a0China\u00a0where I can live close to my parents. However, I am only in my first year, so things may change.", "How many languages do you speak?", "I speak two languages, English and Mandarin, but I have plans [for] someday learning Japanese and French.", "Do you get homesick by living away from home?", "Living away from home at a young age can be tough and I do sometimes get homesick. As you know, everyone has his or her own way of dealing with homesickness. I quite often like to indulge my sweet tooth when I\u2019m missing home; that seems to do the trick, although not a long-term solution! Or sometimes I go to Chinatown for a typical\u00a0Chinese meal that will remind me of home, or a simple snack from the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0supermarket. Over the past year I have been lucky to make additional friends from outside university at my local church; they have become like family.", "What are the things you value the most in your student accommodation?", "Friendly neighbors or roommates are a must! Last year, I had an American neighbor who was lovely, and the fact that she wasn\u2019t\u00a0Chinese\u00a0meant I was forced to practice my English. It improved drastically as we spent lots of time chatting together after class. We are still great friends today despite not living together anymore. Being able to cook is also very important, especially when living with students from other nationalities as you can learn about foreign foods, and most importantly, how to make your favorite foreign dishes.", "Where are you living and how did you choose your accommodation?", "I am living at The Costume Store, 160 Victoria Road, London W3 6UL,\u00a0which is managed by The Student Housing Company. The property has an exclusive agreement with my university to house students at Central Saint Martins so we are all design students here and I was given priority to live here.", "The most important thing to me when selecting accommodation is the location and how safe the area is. Last year throughout my foundation year, I lived in Whitechapel and I was constantly uneasy about living there. This meant I had to cancel all plans with friends that were scheduled for after\u00a08 p.m. as I didn\u2019t want to come home late alone, which meant I missed out on making a lot of friends. This year, my accommodation is right next to the tube station, a 30-second walk, so it makes everything much easier and I have much more peace of mind.", "Another important aspect to consider is transport: the nearest tube station to my accommodation is North Acton, which is on the Central Line. Even though it is zone 2/3, the direct link on the tube means I can get to Oxford Street in about 20 minutes.", "Finally, cost is a major influencer, especially in a high-cost city like London. Students have to make the choice between location and quality. Sometimes you will sacrifice quality to be in a central location at a cost that fits your budget, or else you can go further out and get the quality and space you like that comes with a longer commute to university. Each student will have their own agenda and has to make the best choice according to their own preference.", "As a student in London, what are top 3 the items you cannot live without?", "Where do you think is the best place to live in London for students?\u00a0", "If I were to ignore the cost, I would say Angel is the best place to live. Angel is on the Northern line on the underground, which means it has excellent direct links to UCL and UAL and the other University of London campuses. There are also plenty of bus routes that link directly to popular destinations in central London such as Chinatown and Oxford Street. The four largest supermarkets are all found in Angel (Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks & Spencer, and Waitrose) along with high street stores, a cinema, and an art store.", "What is the coolest student accommodation building in London?", "I have not yet been there as it yet to open but from what I hear from my friends, Scape Greenwich is an amazing property. It is designed by the famous architects Allford Hall Mohaghan Morris, and from the outside, it looks like a luxury residential block of apartments. I will be sure to visit it once it\u2019s open. Nido in King\u2019s Cross and in Spitalfields are also very popular, cool buildings.", "What are your favorite luxury brands and why?", "Montblanc is one of my favorite brands. I first noticed it on a\u00a0Chinese\u00a0soap opera called My Lucky Star and I realized I really like the hexagram they use for the logo. In fact, I did some research on their website and I noticed that all their pens have the iconic hexagram on the cap. I also like their jewelry design as I think it is accessible for younger adults like myself, while the pens are more appropriate gifts to give to a professional or say, your father.", "Clothing-wise, at this point in my life, I would say the only designer brand I would like to spend money on is DKNY as it is probably the most accessible for my student budget. I also think the style is suitable to younger adults. I did some research about the brand before and I learned that the designer and founder is a mother who started because she wanted to design clothes for her daughter. I find that a really lovely story behind the brand and it definitely attracts me to the label.", "Where do you learn about luxury brands? What influences you the most? Friends? Magazines? Online?", "I\u2019m a student at Central Saint Martins where many famous fashion designers originated, such as Alexander McQueen, Zac Posen, Matthew Williamson, and many more. This means I am constantly learning about designers and luxury brands in my day-to-day life here. My colleagues also influence me a lot when we have discussions in class.", "What are your shopping habits like while living in London? Favorite stores? How often do you shop?", "I adore the boutique shops around Covent Garden and this is where I usually shop in London. I find the designs in these boutique stores are far more original and interesting. I usually go shopping at least once a week. Even if I am only browsing, I enjoy shopping around and seeing what\u2019s in stores. I also have a weakness for pretty stationery and my favorite shop to visit is Paperchase.", "What do you think luxury brands should do to better understand the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0living and traveling overseas?", "To be honest, I think\u00a0Chinese\u00a0customers are really important for luxury brands as I always see so many\u00a0Chinese\u00a0in luxury shops in London. Particularly when I went to Bicester Village at the Burberry Outlet Store, I think 60 percent of the customers were\u00a0Chinese. I\u2019m not sure what luxury brands can do to better understand us. I would say to actually take the time to do so would be a good start. Not just think about selling logos to us all the time, but really think about our lifestyle and culture.", "Do you travel during the year? If so, where do you go?", "Not yet. But I\u2019m planning to go Italy this year or next year. That\u2019s a haven for design students. I really want to visit the first Gucci Store in Florence.", "What do you think the travel industry should do to better understand the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0traveler?", "I think when the travel industry should have a specific, unique plan for target travelers. Some travelers may be interested in history and may just want to visit famous buildings from the outside. For young travelers, they mostly often just want to go shopping so this should be taken into consideration. In fact, this is a really important point for people to understand. I find it is horrible to be rushed when shopping!

Ferragamo, Armani, and Burberry\u00a0were some of the companies seeing especially decent first-quarter growth.", "Some luxury brands have been predicting a growth rebound in the second half of this year, but rather than doing so because of an expectation that the crackdown would end, their predictions have been linked to general conditions of China\u2019s economy such as GDP growth and interest rates.

How is China different from other countries in this regard?", "The China digital/social media landscape is highly fragmented and there\u2019s no single Facebook/Twitter channel, but in fact several different versions targeting different groups. There\u2019s no single place where everyone goes, and to be successful in China, you have to be everywhere, which poses an enormous challenge. We recommend to our clients to take a micro-strategy approach, lead with campaigns that excite and entertain consumers, while giving them opportunities to learn more about your brand, and yes, you can lead them to a purchase opportunity while you\u2019re at it. Our most successful campaigns have been those that have taken a single idea and expanded it through a myriad of different executions. Ultimately you need to get people involved, and if you compare Chinese social media content to what is seen in the West, you will see stuff that\u2019s really amped up and engaging. In that way, social media here is way ahead of the West.", "What are some of the common mistakes brands make when marketing to upscale Chinese consumers?", "Upscale brands often fail to take into account that their target audience in China is way younger to the group they normally target in Europe. Of course there\u2019s a certain image that luxury brands need to project but it\u2019s done much more conservatively than it needs to be, and the engagement strategy has to be more engaging than print ads at the airport or some VIP event.

His point here is that China social media is much more two-way, involved and engaging than what you might see on Facebook. Your task as a brand, therefore, is to create campaigns that get Chinese netizens to participate, not just to watch. To make matters more challenging, the average Chinese follows only eight companies on their Weibo, compared to 15 companies for the average American. Your social media campaigns, therefore, need to be \u201cdialed up,\u201d providing content that followers can\u2019t wait to forward to their friends. If you\u2019re simply posting product pictures you will lose. You need to give your local teams in China a lot more leverage to do what they want.

From contextual evidence, however, we can point to a variety of several causes, some of which may be interconnected, that are all likely doing their part to contribute to the slowdown. These include not only the anti-extravagance campaign and changing consumer taste, but also China\u2019s overall slowing economic growth.", "The Chinese government is working hard to convince the public that it will no longer tolerate taxpayer money going to lavish banquets.

Meanwhile, some comparatively low-key fashion companies are doing quite well, while haute couture lines are still working on expanding their presence in the country.\u00a0This points to the argument that changing consumer habits which lean toward less ostentatious, logo-heavy styles may be driving this trend.\u00a0\u201cThe truth is, the luxury market in China was in decline well before the anti-corruption campaign was introduced,\u201d states Business of Fashion, which argues, \u201cWhile many consumers still purchase luxury goods with blatant logos stamped across them as loud displays of status and wealth \u2026 new consumption patterns can be seen, especially amongst young people.\u201d", "Further complicating the issue is the fact that it is difficult to tell how much of this decline in an obsession with \u201cbling\u201d is influenced by the crackdown itself. Watches once again provide the most obvious example of officials taking pains to avoid conspicuous displays of wealth. According to Euromonitor International, \u201cThis time last year, there were more Chinese government officials and company executives sporting Cartier or Rolex timepieces than you could shake a stick at. Today, many of those same luxury timepieces are locked up in drawers at home or are on sale at second-hand stores such as Brand Off in Shanghai. Most government officials wouldn\u2019t be seen dead wearing one.\u201d Even officials\u2019 wives haven\u2019t been exempt from being called out on Weibo for the logos on their handbags, showing that not all stealth wealth may be simply a matter of voluntary change of taste. \u00a0Although Chinese consumers\u2019 tastes have been getting more sophisticated on their own, it\u2019s hard to tell how much this trend is being helped along by government diatribes against ostentation.", "Also not to be discounted are China\u2019s slowing economic growth and the amount of government funding going to public works. China is still heavily invested in driving economic growth through the funding of infrastructure projects, but as economic recovery has progressed since the 2008 crisis, the government has been less extravagant with its public financing of these projects. Although not connected to the anti-extravagance campaign, less public money for major projects leads to far less opportunity for bribery, which in turn may be indirectly contributing to the slowdown. In addition, China\u2019s lower-than-predicted GDP growth numbers and the economic uncertainty accompanying the leadership transition may have had their impacts on retail.", "The bottom line is that even amidst all this short-term uncertainty, luxury companies still see China as an investment for the long run.

Reflecting the speed at which brands have learned from \u2014 and, in many cases, surpassed \u2014 digital early adopters, beauty brands in particular showed the most impressive gains over the past year, with Est\u00e9e Lauder topping the list of 100 prestige brands through savvy use of social media, digital marketing, and on- and offline synergy.", "One of the key points made in this year\u2019s study is that China\u2019s luxury market continues to become increasingly competitive, fragmented, and global. Though 2012 was a comparatively difficult year for the mainland China luxury market, which only mustered single-digit growth, purchases by Chinese tourist-shoppers outside of China indicated that demand has shown little sign of diminishing. According to Doug Guthrie, Dean of the George Washington School of Business,\u00a0\u201cWhile mainland China\u2019s organic luxury sales growth softened to low single digits, Chinese\u00a0tourist spend was up 58 percent in Q3 of 2012, suggesting consumer demand is stronger than\u00a0ever.\u201d\u00a0This has been particularly good for the fashion, beauty, and watches/jewelry brands that made some of the greatest gains on the new Digital IQ Index. As Jing Daily has previously noted, Chinese outbound tourists have traditionally targeted brands in these segments when traveling to popular destinations like South Korea, France and the US, as well as at airport duty-free shops worldwide.", "This year\u2019s ranking is perhaps more important to watch than ever, as 2012 was arguably the toughest year to date for many luxury brands operating in the China market. Amid a government crackdown on public spending on luxury goods, a backlash against conspicuous consumption in top-tier cities, greater scrutiny of government officials\u2019 watches and cars, and more selective buying by consumers spooked by slower macroeconomic growth, spending has been less splashy and consumers have largely trended towards the low-key. Brands have mostly followed suit, with some of the biggest events this year \u2014 such as the Hugo Boss 3D runway show and the launch of Montblanc\u2019s Beijing flagship \u2014 having a stronger digital component than in 2011, when brands mostly held exclusive, lavish, star-studded launch events.", "More than 5,500 Burberry Body virtual badges were awarded on Jiepang earlier this year", "Yet even brands that went the extra mile with their digital overtures to China didn\u2019t always see success.

The study also makes clear that what works for one brand in the digital sphere doesn\u2019t necessarily work for others. While some highly publicized online events this year (such as #37-ranked Armani\u2019s eponymous Tweet Talks event) fizzled, others (like #13-ranked Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cFrom Paris to Shanghai\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Invitation Au Voyage\u201d videos) proved exceedingly popular with Chinese netizens.", "Though #10-ranked Burberry had a mixed year in China, with sales dipping this summer, its digital efforts resonated deeply with Chinese audiences.

Brands\u2019 Chinese sites average abysmal\u00a0load times of 24.1 seconds, four times as long as their global\u00a0counterparts. More than half of brands sites have yet to be ICP (government) certified, meaning their pages are at risk of being removed from search results. While brand mobile investment targeting Chinese consumers has risen by\u00a0double-digits, only\u00a023 percent of brands maintain a mobile-optimized version of their China site and only a third of these sites are e-commerce enabled. And while China\u2019s luxury e-commerce market continues to grow by leaps and bounds, only four brands have launched direct e-commerce since 2011. Clearly, if brands are to take full advantage of the China opportunity and the rise of the inland consumer, they\u2019ll have to take a cue from the likes of\u00a0Est\u00e9e\u00a0Lauder, Chow Tai Fook, or Audi and figure out how to get consumers truly interested, engaged, and ready to open their wallets.", "To download the full rankings and key highlights from the report, click here.

Surprisingly, Louis Vuitton does not succeed in obtaining the top position in the major Asian markets of China and Japan, in spite of the brand being somewhat synonymous with luxury handbags in the region.

For others, Chinese demand may mean near future stability; however, we can certainly foresee some brands going down the same path that Louis Vuitton has encountered in Japan. As the Chinese shopper becomes increasingly seasoned, and the middle class continues its rise, the question brands encounter is no longer how to sell the Chinese consumer their first bag, but how to sell them their third or fourth.

But if luxury marketers grasp the full meaning of digital, they will realize it offers both and much more. Today, digital is the creative convergence of digital arts, science, technology and business for human expression, communication, social interaction and education. It has come a long way since the birth of the Internet. Digital has penetrated almost all aspects of our social and personal life. Experts have mapped this evolution from the days of monolithic websites, content creation, user participation and the birth of virtual lives to now when the digital domain has a distinct social dimension to it.", "2. Digital can help engage China\u2019s younger luxury buyers.", "Most luxury brands are still in the digital Stone Age. This is not because of limited understanding of the digital world but also because most of these luxury brands were born in markets where the average luxury buyer was older and thus relatively less Net savvy. In Asia, and more specifically in China, things are a little different. In China 80 percent of wealthy consumers are under 45. Compare this with the figure for US (30 percent) and Japan (19 percent), according to the McKinsey Global Institute.", "3. Digital content can give social currency.", "With more and more millionaires in town, luxury is no longer just about the price of the car or the size of the Persian carpet that one has bought \u2013 it is increasingly about the story behind the making of the object or the unique experience that it promises. As the newly rich evolve, thoughts are gaining currency over things and \u201cexperience is becoming more important than expensive\u201d.", "Digital content for luxury brands needs to offer something that\u2019s worth sharing. Imagine things such as a first-hand account of space tourism or the experience of climbing virgin peaks across continents. Such stories and experiences have immense chat value and give valuable social currency to people who can access it. Similarly, digital also needs to offer content that can be shared among fans of brands who might not always own the products but aspire to it. This group provides the much-needed buzz for the brand.", "Dior will promoted its first China couture event in Shanghai on April 14 online", "4. Digital can create a community around a brand\u2019s mythology.", "Luxury brands have rich histories and heritages. Almost all successful luxury brands have rich traditions and mythologies. Similarly a luxury buyer craves a community of like-minded people. He desires to be a part of an exclusive club. Luxury brands have an important role to play here.", "Add to this the fact that in countries such as China and India, with vast populations and relatively lower service standards, it is not always easy to serve the luxury buyer at a store. Digital is the missing link that can bridge this gap. While luxury offers exclusivity, digital can help provide privacy and personalization. Digital communities are a powerful way to make people feel special. In the long run such a community can also help better segment and service a brand\u2019s buyers based on their interests. These communities of ardent fans and loyalists do not just know a lot about the brand, but can play a role as brand custodians online.", "5. Digital offers youthful energy (but it is different from being a youth brand).", "As luxury brands reach out to younger luxury buyers, they run the risk of mixing youthful energy with the notion of a youth brand. They need to balance youthful energy with elegance.\u00a0It is important that marketers view the digital realm as a platform for the brand to listen to younger prospects and be inspired by them.

According to the magazine\u2019s \u201cChina Top Wristwatch Report,\u201d despite a general contraction of China\u2019s overall watch market, the luxury sector continues to see \u201cblow-out-like demand\u201d from the country\u2019s newly wealthy, with watches becoming commonly used both to make fashion statements and for gift-giving purposes.", "Purporting to be the first of its kind in China, the report surveyed 157 \u201cfrequent\u201d luxury watch buyers with annual income that ranged upwards into the millions of yuan, along with 23 luxury watch brand execs.", "According to the China Customs Information Center, luxury watch imports rose an impressive 49 percent in 2011 to nearly 90,000 units.

As Zhou Ting, associate professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and lead author of the report, said this week, \u201cUnlike other luxury goods like cosmetics, perfume and handbags, which are often bought overseas, 59% of luxury watches are bought from domestic stores.\u201d This fact has boosted profits for brands like Chanel and Burberry, which sell but do not specialize in watches, which have spent the last several years expanding rapidly into less sophisticated second- and third-tier cities.", "As Zhou added, pressure among white-collar workers, even those considered far from middle-class from Western standards, to purchase premium watches has been a boon for brands that offer a range of watches at different price-points. \u201cAlthough they contribute very little to the market (now),\u201d Zhou pointed out, \u201c[white-collar workers could become] the largest potential driving force\u201d in the market in the years ahead."]}, {"title": "China\u2019s Expected Luxury Tax Cuts May Not Spur Domestic Consumption", "meta": "March 9, 2012", "paragraphs": ["Cutting one tax among many might not be enough to dissuade Hong Kong-bound tourist-shoppers", "One of the big stories this week in China\u2019s luxury market was the possibility that Beijing may soon lower China\u2019s notoriously high luxury taxes, which can tack upwards of 30-40 percent onto the price of imported high-end goods. Along with a raft of other factors, such as better customer service and choice and prestige among friends, much higher prices for luxury goods within mainland China has been singled out as a key reason more than half of Chinese luxury purchases are currently made overseas. As former deputy commerce minister Wei Jianguo told\u00a0China Daily this week, \u201cThere will be at least two rounds of reductions this year on a large range of goods.\u201d", "Wei\u2019s remarks follow the release of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao\u2019s annual government work report this Monday, which again prioritized domestic consumption.

By June, Ministry of Commerce spokesman Yao Jian sought to inject himself into the debate, saying, \u201cthe direction [the government] will take is to further reduce import tariffs on middle- and high-end products.\u201d", "By October, though, little had been done. Instead of moving quickly to cut luxury taxes, bureaucrats in Beijing had busied themselves trying to pin down the exact meaning of the word \u201cluxury.\u201d As Lu Peijun, deputy head of the General Administration of Customs, told China Daily at the time, \u201cTariff cuts are an issue of the top priority with policymakers. However, the definition of luxury products should be made more accurate to better delineate tariff policies.\u201d Along with semantic roadblocks, another reason given by analysts for Beijing\u2019s slow moves was infighting between the Ministries of Finance and Commerce on what should be done. While the Ministry of Commerce strongly supports tariff cuts to spur more Chinese consumers to shop domestically, China Daily notes that the Ministry of Finance opposes the cuts. And in typically opaque fashion, Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said in October that \u201cit\u2019s unclear whether the two ministries have reached a consensus.\u201d", "By the end of 2011, after months of wrangling, the only progress seen on the luxury tax reduction was a vague assurance by Beijing that import taxes would be reduced for 730 consumer products, including high-end cosmetics, cigarettes and liquor. However, as Jing Daily pointed out last month, these moves have had little effect, as price increases of anywhere from 5-15 percent by the brands themselves have outpaced tax reductions (which averaged a weak 4.4 percent).", "Though we\u2019ll wait to see whether Beijing enacts another round of more comprehensive tax reforms for the luxury sector, we\u2019re skeptical that any further moves will spur domestic consumption in any significant way. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, the luxury tax in China is just one tariff among many that is tacked on to imported goods.

With all eyes on what effect a slowing property market and tighter credit could have on spending by the country\u2019s emerging middle class as well as its estimated 960,000 millionaires next year \u2014 whether they\u2019ll cut back or actually spend more on portable assets like art, gold and diamonds, and fine wine \u2014 we can glean some clues to what we might see in these eight trends that took shape this year.", "Brands are now more conscious of netizen perceptions in China", "Conspicuous consumption may be very slowly going the way of the dodo among China\u2019s more sophisticated luxury consumers as disdain towards overt extravagance grows in major urban centers, but that hasn\u2019t stopped some from flaunting their wealth online in a blatant attempt at fame or notoriety. This summer, scandal broke when a young woman, Guo Meimei, who claimed to work as general manager of the Red Cross Society of China, posted photos of her many luxury handbags and cars on Sina Weibo. A firestorm of criticism, both of Guo and the Red Cross, soon ensued, despite the quick denial by the Red Cross of China, and admission by Guo herself, that she had ever been an employee.", "With public disdain for conspicuous consumption, Netizen wariness about the \u201crich second generation\u201d and princelings, and government involvement in banning certain advertisements coming to a head in China, the effect on the luxury industry has been palpable in 2011. In the year ahead, we expect the adoption of \u201clow-key luxury\u201d to gain pace, particularly in economic and political power centers like Beijing and Shanghai.", "This progression is perhaps natural, and not terribly surprising, since lower-key luxury has been the name of the game in developed markets like Europe and North America since the financial crisis of 2008. Some of China\u2019s more sophisticated shoppers have gone this direction anyway, in response to the growing ubiquity of Louis Vuitton and Gucci over the past several years.

For years, the high-end wine market in China has been the domain of French wineries, with the country accounting for around 55 percent of China\u2019s wine imports. And arguably no French wine-growing region has achieved the level of success in China seen by Bordeaux, with top-tier regional winemakers like Ch\u00e2teau Lafite achieving such ubiquity on the tables and in the cellars of the wealthy that China is joked to have more bottles of 1982 Lafite circulating around than have ever been produced.", "Over the course of this year\u2019s spring and autumn auctions in Hong Kong, though, a clear sea change has become apparent, perhaps due to a sort of \u201cLafite bubble,\u201d perhaps due to rampant counterfeiting of top Bordeaux, or possibly just due to changing tastes. Following the Bordeaux-heavy October 2 auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong that became the auction house\u2019s first since 2009 to fail to sell out, and (as a counterpoint) last month\u2019s massively successful, Burgundy-weighted Acker Merrall & Condit sale, which took in a grand total of US$14.5 million and became the city\u2019s biggest wine auction of the year, speculation that Burgundy in general, and top-tier labels like Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti\u00a0specifically, is China\u2019s \u201cnext big thing\u201d \u2014 and will continue to gain popularity in 2012 \u2014 has hit fever pitch.", "See Jing Daily Coverage: \u201cRecent Record-Breaking Sales Underline China\u2019s New Thirst For Roman\u00e9e-Conti\u201d (December 13)", "Bentley recorded record sales in China this year", "Though demand for luxury cars is showing signs of slowing somewhat in China at the mid- to premium range, the ultra-luxury segment seems to be largely unscathed, particularly for limited-edition models.

This year, dozens of online retailers crowded into China\u2019s nascent high-end e-commerce market, including domestic media portals like Sina and new upstarts like Shangpin, along with international players like Yoox. According to the research firm Analysys International, the luxury online retail market in China may achieve annual turnover of 16 billion yuan (US$2.5 billion) in 2011, with Analysys projecting that figure could rise to 20 billion yuan (US$3.1 billion) annually within the next two years.", "But with dozens of luxury-focused online retailers to choose from, many of which are very well capitalized, the industry may be in dire need of a shakeout.

While these industry \u201cgrowing pains\u201d may be tough for recent entrants to the luxury space, a shakeout will likely be ultimately good for Chinese consumers themselves, as market leaders are likely going to have to continue to increase service offerings (such as thecorner\u2019s courier service, which lets customers try on their purchases while a deliveryman waits) and stocking better inventory while still aggressively competing on price.", "See Jing Daily Coverage: \u201cStorm Clouds Loom Over China\u2019s Red-Hot Luxury E-Commerce Market\u201d (October 17)", "Zhang Xiaogang\u2019s \u201cForever Lasting Love\u201d sold last spring for US$10.1 million", "Since their emergence on the global auction scene in 2008-2009, China\u2019s new generation of art, antique, wine and jewelry collectors has become one of the most powerful group of buyers on the planet, showing up at auctions in Beijing, Hong Kong, London and New York to snap up some of the best lots, disregarding estimates and fueling dozens of world record sales. Coming off a whirlwind 2010, during which new Chinese collectors all but pushed the formerly dominant Western collectors of Chinese contemporary art completely out of the market and turned their attention to blue-chip Chinese artists like Zhang Xiaogang, Liu Ye, Zeng Fanzhi and Yue Minjun, this year\u2019s spring auctions in Hong Kong proved wildly successful. As the year drew to a close, autumn auctions by the likes of Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong continued to record strong sales, but after months of tightening credit and a property slowdown, the newest of the new Chinese collectors showed a more cautious and discerning streak, mostly buying the best pieces by top-tier Chinese contemporary artists and traditional Chinese paintings.", "Though many commentators were quick to conclude that fewer high-profile sales this autumn in Hong Kong indicated a slowdown in the Chinese contemporary art market, an ArtTactic survey published in November indicated that confidence in the market among domestic collectors remains far higher than that seen among American and European collectors. For well-known pieces by blue-chip Chinese artists like Zeng Fanzhi, Zhang Xiaogang, Zhou Chunya and Liu Ye, sales remained strong in 2011, but the more selective buying of Chinese collectors in the second half of the year indicates that the market is maturing quickly \u2014 a trend that is, by all measures, good for its development. In the year ahead, look for the buying trends among new Chinese collectors to remain broadly blue-chip focused at the highest end (US$200,000-1 million+), with the wealthiest buyers still fixated on the best lots by the artists singled out in ArtTactic\u2019s long-term longevity ranking. Collectors just getting started in the market will likely purchase more works by the artists championed by domestic Chinese auction houses like Beijing Poly and China Guardian, the likes of Shi Chong and Ye Yongqing, who have little international exposure or notoriety.", "In the year ahead, we expect to see the Chinese art market and, in particular, the Hong Kong auction market continue to gain strength as more wealthy Chinese look for more stable investment options and look to art, wine, gold and jewelry in the face of a strengthening yuan, few alternative investment options, a struggling real estate market and higher inflation.", "See Jing Daily Coverage: \u201cChinese Collectors Are Basically Looking At Chinese Art\u201d (October 24)", "Mainland Chinese tourists have become a critical source of revenue for luxury brands in Hong Kong", "China\u2019s high luxury taxes, which tack an additional 30-40 percent onto the price of high-end goods, have been instrumental in the growth of Hong Kong\u2019s luxury market, as mainland Chinese have flocked to the former British colony to enjoy tax-free shopping, better inventory and customer service, and the newest collections for years. But in 2011, pushback against Beijing\u2019s high punitive luxury taxes hit fever pitch, with high-powered businesspeople like Wang Jianlin \u2014 chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group \u2014 assailing the central government\u2019s failure to spur domestic consumption and, in Wang\u2019s words, lead Chinese consumers to \u201c\u201csit on airplanes to deliver jobs and tax money to foreign countries.\u201d", "With high luxury taxes making everything from imported clothing to electronics around 45 percent more expensive in mainland China than in Hong Kong and 51 percent higher than in the U.S., public support for tax reform remains high. Still, according to analysts cited by China Daily this October, part of the reason Beijing continues to drag its feet comes down to sheer bureaucratic inefficiency. While the Ministry of Commerce strongly supports tariff cuts to spur more Chinese consumers to shop domestically rather than jetting off to Hong Kong, New York or Paris for their luxury shopping sprees, the Ministry of Finance opposes the cuts. And in typically opaque fashion, the latest details announced by Shen Danyang, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, were that \u201cit\u2019s unclear whether the two ministries have reached a consensus.\u201d", "Despite these bureaucratic hangups, the massive spending seen among mainland Chinese tourist-shoppers in Hong Kong and Macau, and further afield in New York, Paris and London in 2011 might finally make things click in Beijing in 2012. This past summer, the Chinese resort island of Hainan \u2014 the country\u2019s southernmost province \u2014 enacted a new duty-free program for luxury goods that has been, by most standards, a success, with the Sanya Duty-Free Store receiving more than 1.3 million visitors in its first 100 days alone. By the end of the year, we saw Kunming, in southwest China\u2019s Yunnan province, enact a similar pilot program in the hopes of rivaling Hong Kong or Macau for the duty-free shopper yuan.", "Considering Sanya and Kunming are no real match for Hong Kong\u2019s highly developed luxury market, unless major changes to the luxury tax code are announced and put in place in 2012, look for mainland Chinese shoppers to continue looking elsewhere for their high-end goods \u2014 online, overseas, or second-hand.", "See Jing Daily Coverage: \u201cChina\u2019s Luxury Tax Reduction: Will It Actually Boost Domestic Consumption?\u201d (June 17)", "Hong Kong jeweler Chow Tai Fook has over 1,300 locations, mostly in mainland China", "In a year that saw major brands like Samsonite, Prada, and jeweler Chow Tai Fook line up to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange to fuel greater expansion in the mainland China market, by the second half of 2011 IPOs in the city began to falter, leading many other interested companies to go into \u201cwait-and-see\u201d mode. Following a nearly year-long tear of IPOs that saw brands like L\u2019Occitane and the Chinese cosmetics powerhouse SaSa International successfully list in Hong Kong, Prada\u2019s IPO proved the largest of 2011, with the Italian luxury powerhouse raising about US$2.5 billion after listing in June, but disappointing listings by the Hong Kong-based jewelry giant Chow Tai Fook raising a little more than US$2 billion in its IPO \u2014 which had been expected to raise upwards of US$3.5 billion \u2014 have made some other companies more gun-shy.", "Still, earlier this month, New York-based Coach unveiled its secondary listing in Hong Kong, and in the months ahead analysts expect major brands like Britain\u2019s Aston Martin and Burberry, Italy\u2019s Ducati, and possibly even LVMH listing there, in the hopes of raising expansion capital to chase the mainland\u2019s emerging inland wealth.

According to World Tourism Organization estimates, international Chinese tourists \u2014 led by the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class \u2014 should number 100 million by 2020, up from only 31 million in 2005. As the UN organization added in a study last year, China has recorded growth of around 22 percent per year in overseas trips, making it the world\u2019s fastest-growing market in terms of expenditure on overseas travel for the last decade. This growth has made mainland Chinese tourists among the most coveted international tourist demographics in major destinations like Australia \u2014 which expects a $9 billion windfall from these travelers per year by 2020 \u2014 as well as New York, London and Paris, where individual travelers and tour groups currently contribute millions per year to the local economy.", "In response, demand for Mandarin-speaking staff not only in top destinations like Paris or New York, but also in cities like Madrid, saw a boom in 2011. With more mainland Chinese tourists set to take their second, third or even fourth overseas trip in 2012, we can expect their demands to continue deepening into the experiential realm, and expect to see specific packages like French wine tours, Japanese skiing tours, and New York or Los Angeles real estate tours to increase in number. Though many, if not most, mainland Chinese new to overseas travel will likely stick to the traditional tour-bus itinerary, donning brightly colored hats and following flag-toting guides around the Louvre, look for more worldly travelers to travel independently, seek out more individualized travel \u201cexperiences,\u201d and head to destinations off the beaten path.", "See Jing Daily Coverage: \u201c2011 Chinese Outbound Tourism Spending Expected To Reach $55 Billion\u201d (December 20)", "From the entire Jing Daily team in New York, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, thanks for reading in 2011.

While demand in the US rose seven percent last year, however, China recorded a 25 percent surge. As Jing Daily wrote in September, in response to this booming demand, major diamond retailers like Harry Winston, Van Cleef & Arpels, Tiffany & Co. and others have geared up for massive expansion in mainland China over the past two years, as diamond engagement rings have become a \u201cmust\u201d for young couples, luxury consumption has surged, and wealthy urbanites have started to see the precious stones as good \u201cportable investments.\u201d Though Graff Diamonds is comparatively new to China, with only two locations in mainland China, the company has poised itself for success in China, first gaining a foothold in Hong Kong, then plotting a deliberate expansion into Beijing and Shanghai, and in May linking up with the Chinese artist Peng Wei on its latest advertising campaign.

According to the brand, Guangzhou\u2019s lack of a well-defined market has been the main factor in its seven-year hiatus.", "Interestingly enough, for a brand that\u2019s been absent from a fast-growing and important city for so long, the opening of Gucci\u2019s new Guangzhou boutique shortly before the May 1 holiday came not with a bang but with a whimper. No high-profile, star-studded event, no parties, just a store opening like any other. While this kind of modest re-launch would be par for the course in most cities, it seems to have rubbed Guangzhou\u2019s fashion and luxury press the wrong way. Coming off of a year in which the city held prestigious events like the\u00a02010 Asian Games, according to the Yangcheng Evening News (\u7f8a\u57ce\u665a\u62a5), many of Guangzhou\u2019s more fashionable residents expected to see major labels head to the city in droves, rushing to open ever more lavish flagships.

Gucci opened its first store in Chongqing this March with a star-studded event that brought in celebrities like [actress] Carina Lau for the ribbon-cutting, yet its return to Guangzhou was a silent affair.

Gucci remained the only holdout, choosing instead to leave the Guangzhou market entirely for reasons unknown. Maybe Gucci\u2019s strategy of leaving Guangzhou and coming back in a low-key fashion seven years later is a form of very slow marketing. Of course, Guangzhou shoppers are already very familiar with Gucci, so maybe we don\u2019t need a lot of pomp and circumstance \u2014 we\u2019ll make our way to the new Gucci store on our own.", "Still, many are disappointed in Gucci\u2019s quiet return to Guangzhou, thinking that the brand missed an excellent promotional opportunity.

What\u2019s more important for the Guangzhou luxury scene is that Taikoo Hui [shopping mall] will finally open in Guangzhou within the next two years, which will bring with it plenty of flagship stores.

Is it better to save your lavish grand opening celebrations for younger, more rapidly growing markets in inland China, such as Chongqing or Kunming, where consumers are less brand-savvy and will be more easily wowed by celebrity appearances? Is the low-key launch (or re-launch, in the case of Gucci in Guangzhou) better for top-tier cities, or is it simply too risky? Clearly, Gucci is formulating an expansion strategy in China that puts it at odds with brands like Burberry, which recently held an extravagant blowout to celebrate its new Beijing flagship, and Diane Von Furstenberg, who held an arguably more over-the-top Red Ball in Shanghai.

Considering the city\u2019s Gingko Center mall recorded a respectable 2 billion yuan (US$308 million) in sales last year, and Kunming has become a destination for villa-buying Chinese celebrities, expansion into Yunnan\u2019s capital is probably a smart move.", "To get a temperature reading of a given Chinese city\u2019s luxury market, a good indicator is always a Louis Vuitton flagship, and soon Kunming will be home to the largest LV flagship in all of southwestern China.

We should not be dismissive or selective and instead view Chinese tourists as valued guests.

That is why we need corporate marketing and aggressive strategies to lure them. ", "We need the kind of products that tourists can buy and enjoy only in Korea.

We\u2019ll have to wait and see if (and how) Korea would more actively promote these things in China, but considering Japan continues to promote itself as a luxury shopping mecca, and countries like Singapore are increasing their direct overtures to Chinese tourists as well, Korea will essentially have no choice but to differentiate itself in China as it transitions its own tourism industry to a more China-focused one.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "2011 Trend Watch: Luxury Brands Targeting Chongqing", "meta": "January 21, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Maison Mode Times (\u7f8e\u7f8e\u65f6\u4ee3\u767e\u8d27) in Chongqing", "Considering it\u2019s\u00a0larger than Taiwan and nearly as populous as Canada, it is somewhat surprising that many of the world\u2019s top luxury brands have yet to enter Chongqing, one of China\u2019s four direct-controlled municipalities.

Although domestic shopping still makes up less than 50% of luxury spending among Chinese consumers (44%, to be exact), the study notes that this is changing as more brands have focused on providing latest collections in the mainland market, including lower-ticket items in mainland inventories, and reducing operating margins to offset the tax difference. Going on, Bain identifies five main reasons Chinese shoppers will choose to shop locally rather than overseas: a desire to be perceived as a \u201cVIP,\u201d a better shopping experience, better size availability, access to service after sales, and impulse. As expected, the two main reasons Chinese shoppers will purchase luxury items overseas remain lower prices and a broader product selection.", "Another interesting finding is the growing importance of the Internet as an information source.

Initiating active localization strategies, rather than relying on passive marketing, is another reason many brands want full control of their direction in the China market.", "Currently, many luxury brands have already begun to treat China the same as the American, European or Japanese markets, introducing high-end goods localized for the local culture and arts and contracting local designers for collections. Recently, Herm\u00e8s \u2014 which has 18 stores in the Chinese market \u2014 announced that it will launch a new brand in China, Shang Xia. According to reports, \u201cShang Xia\u201d is a \u201cChinese brand,\u201d and will be made based on Chinese traditional handicrafts and culture, using Chinese designers, R&D and production facilities.", "Herm\u00e8s\u2019 North Asia managing director said in an interview that the first Shang Xia boutique will be located in Shanghai, and will mainly sell home products like tableware and furniture with traditional Chinese cultural themes.", "As China\u2019s luxury market advances by leaps and bounds, the relationship between luxury brands and the Chinese market connection has intensified. It\u2019s understood that Burberry\u2019s Black Label and Blue\u00a0Label\u00a0will only be available in Hong Kong and Japan.

According to Zhang, if they are to compete with the dominant western luxury brands, Chinese luxury goods brands need to be bold enough to break with the prevailing fashion order and create and play by their own rules.", "Below is an interview with NE-TIGER\u2019s Zhang Zhifeng conducted at the conference:", "The media call you \u201cThe pioneer of the Chinese luxury brand industry\u201d. As the first person in China to establish a luxury brand enterprise, what are the major difficulties and challenges you have encountered over the past 2 decades? What kind of advice or suggestions could you give to your counterparts in the industry?", "I started my business in 1982 and founded the brand of NE.TIGER in 1992 \u2013 now it\u2019s been 28 years. For many years, I have been the first one in China to have built not only a luxury brand but also a guideline or a theory in the field as well as to have put it into practice. Meanwhile, I have been sharing my experience with my counterparts in the industry. As a Chinese proverb says, \u201cIt takes a decade to sharpen a sword\u201d.", "In each of these passing decades, we have walked, along with our nation, a path from self-awakening to self-sufficiency, and from independence to prosperity. Accompanied by the peaceful emergence of the Chinese nation, we are now embracing with confidence a new era of renaissance and revitalization in Chinese luxury civilization: that is the revitalization of the ancient Chinese luxury civilization and the development of Chinese luxury brands.", "Since the birth of NE.TIGER, we have pursued a course of dedicated study and research into the history and the culture of the luxury goods both in the East and the West. During the process, we found it is evident that the history of luxury goods in China dates back a very long time, and we might even say that China once conquered the world with its luxury products. I give you three examples: the first, in 139 B.C., the Silk Road established by ZHANG QIAN during the Han Dynasty extended into Persia, brought fine and exquisite Chinese silks as far as the Roman Empire, the center of Europe of the time, which was regarded as the lead of fashion. The second example is dated 1800 years ago. China in the TANG dynasty was not only the political, economic, and cultural center of the world, but also the center of fashion, as we can see today from how ladies were dressed in ancient frescoes and stone sculptures, indicating the splendid and open culture of fashion in the TANG Dynasty. We can even find many of its reflections and influence in evening gowns nowadays.", "My last example: in the MING Dynasty, the years between 1405 to 1433, ZHENG HE, sent by the Chinese government, voyaged 7 times to the West with hundreds of boats full of Chinese silk, Yun brocade, jade, China, tea and other renowned Chinese luxury products given as gifts to the world where they went. It was the peak time of the \u2018Silk Road of the Sea\u2019. That not only showed the grace of a Chinese nation of courtesy but also illustrated how China contributed to the culture and tradition of the appreciation and the consumption of luxury goods in the west.", "NE-TIGER's designs are imbued with Chinese design and cultural elements", "Unfortunately, the Chinese feudal system restricted the birth of luxury brands as opposed to luxury products, and as a result of the lost opportunity of the industrial revolution it was only very recently that China started the development of luxury goods through building brands and enterprises.", "As far as our challenge and difficulty is concerned, through the 30 years since the beginning of the reform in China, like the sea opening itself to the inflow of hundreds of rivers, many foreign luxury brands have entered into the Chinese market rapidly. To their great satisfaction, all those brands have not only encountered in China the best opportunities they have ever seen for one century or two \u2013 since their birth in their own home markets \u2013 but also they have been granted privileged status and super-super-national treatment by Chinese, which never happened to them elsewhere. They come here to invade cities and to occupy the land, to grab the market and to pan for gold in our prosperity.", "Meanwhile, some high-end shopping malls and department stores in major Chinese cities, for the sake of their own short-term interest, are willing to open the doors and to bow down themselves in front of foreign luxury brands by offering many privileges. For instance, foreign brands are always offered considerable discounts, the best locations, extended rent exemptions for a couple of years, covering cost for store renovation of the openings, reduced fees, etc. \u2013 all of these contribute to their rapid expansion in China. I cite here an example of a well-known western luxury brand. In a famous commercial avenue in Beijing, within 300 meters, it opened 3 stores in the past 2 years, at nearly zero cost.", "However in contrast, most new-born Chinese luxury brands are not treated fairly here and have to operate under considerable restrictions. Moreover, in the markets where there is only market reform and no market openings such as in the US and in Europe, we experience actual discrimination. In spite of all these facts, we take pride in the passion, loyalty, recognition and support of our customers. We believe that as our brands grow such difficulties will be just temporary, and with the cultivation of our brands, we can transform the challenges that we face into opportunities.", "Chinese luxury brands have global vision and our major advantage is that we have our roots in our 5000-year civilization. However, it\u2019s not enough. We should apply our innovation on it, in order to give it a new life. The advice I would like to give to my counterparts is that, I think Chinese luxury brands should be bold enough to challenge and to overcome the established centers of influence, to establish new rules, and to create new leadership in the industry.", "The huge potential of the Chinese market has attracted more and more attention from global luxury brands. They are entering into the Chinese market with more and more Chinese elements (Such as Chanel holding its fashion show in Shanghai). Some even started to build their own Chinese brand (such as \u201cShang-Xia \u201d of Hermes) by hiring local Chinese designers. Compared with these experienced luxury brands, what kind of advantage do you have, to build up a Chinese luxury brand?", "Europe became the first tier for luxury goods consumption within one or two centuries. The US became the second tier for luxury goods consumption after the Second World War within 50 years as the biggest economic force in the world. In the recent 30 years, with a developed Japan and an emerging China, East Asia is nowadays the third tier for luxury goods consumption. Despite the global recession of luxury goods consumption, China has a yearly growth rate of 20% to 30%. Currently, the consumption of luxury goods in China occupies 25% of global consumption, surpassing the US and becoming the top second nation in luxury goods consumption. The Chinese market is attracting the world\u2019s attention.", "NE-TIGER", "The European brands which we are familiar with, such as Hermes or Louis Vuitton, have a brand history not more than 200 years, and Chanel, Dior, Armani, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana have a history less than 100 years. Today, in the context of the globalization of the economy and the integration of information technologies, as well as a prosperous luxury goods consumption market, China can take much less time in building its own luxury brands, demonstrating another legend to the world.", "Besides, based on the market potential of billions of population, based on China\u2019s 5000 years of civilization and its cultural heritage of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and based on the passion and creativity of the new Chinese generation of designers, I believe in our future in the Chinese luxury brand industry.", "Most foreign luxury brands mainly have their origins in a talented designer or craft person, by offering customers some products fulfilling the need of the time, with excellent quality. This is how their products got popular and got recognized as an icon of the brand in the luxury industry. For example, trench coats from Burberry and its Equestrian Knight label. Chanel dresses and double C label, shoes and scarves of Ferragamo and its G label, etc. However until today, there is not yet any Chinese designer who can lead such a kind of vogue in the world. How do you see this phenomenon?", "As time passed by, the expectation and demand of luxury goods consumers evolved. Nowadays, a noticeable LOGO on a luxury product is not enough to match with consumers\u2019 social identity and status. They are paying more attention to, not only outstanding manufacturing and excellent service, but also appealing philosophy, value, culture and lifestyle that a luxury brand implies. More and more brands have gone beyond their distinctive LOGOs or patterns, and started to seek fashionable, personalized and artistic design in their new products, in order to fulfill consumers\u2019 needs. To demonstrate the luxury in low-profile and to interpret a unique taste is the main trend of today\u2019s luxury brand industry.", "In the age of globalization, the fusion of cultures has reached a new level. And our design concept of \u201cCombination of the ancient and the modern, melting the East and the West\u201d is in the trend.

Hua Fu takes \u201ccourtesy\u201d as spirit, \u201cYun brocades\u201d as material, Chinese embroideries as techniques, Chinese national colors as body. It has characteristics to symbolize, to be classic, to reflect the fusion and compatibility of races & minorities and to represent modernity. Hua Fu is regarded as the inheritor of Chinese civilization and we hope that it carries and spreads Chinese luxury civilization to the places in world where it will lead a trend.", "In which industry do you think a world influential enterprise in the luxury brand industry will be born in China?", "China used to be the major manufacturer of the world garment industry, and now becomes a nation also full of creativity and design capacity. Some Chinese design can even lead the global trend. Globally speaking, the industry which has a higher chance of bringing a Chinese enterprise with the world leading luxury brands must be the fashion industry, such as Chinese haute couture, which carries and reflects the rich Chinese culture background.", "In 2006, I described my theory of \u201cthe renaissance and revitalization of the Chinese luxury brand industry\u201d, as well as my prospects for its bright future. Up to now, we passed through globally eye-catching events such as the Beijing Olympics, 60th anniversary of the P.R.C. and we are looking forward to the Shanghai Expo very soon.

In response to this claim, Cao Lei, a communication director with Hermes in China, said:\u201dZhejiang administration took the samples in December 2009 and we were informed of the results in January 2010.

So what gives? Brands like Hermes, in particular, are renowned for their craftsmanship and quality, so does this mean these companies are indeed lax in their inspection, or does it indicate that they\u2019ve possibly been foisting lower-quality garments on the China market?", "It\u2019s impossible to tell at this point, since most of the companies included in the study have yet to respond. It could be that China\u2019s quality control tests for foreign brands are far more stringent, possibly unfairly so, than they are for domestic companies. However, as we are unable to find specifics about the tests or the testing authority in either English or Chinese, we\u2019ll have to leave that idea up in the air as well.", "Though these testing standards sound a bit opaque, Dan Harris of China Law Blog points out today that any manufacturer exporting their products, whether small or large, must be absolutely sure of what is expected of its products in China before sending the first box. Simply \u201cnot knowing\u201d China\u2019s laws isn\u2019t a defense anymore, and companies risk major PR nightmares if they stay in the dark about quality control or consumer protection laws in China.", "So what could be the end result of this bad publicity for foreign luxury brands? As usual, it\u2019s hard to guess because the China market, and consumer behavior there, is somewhat harder to gauge than older consumer markets like Europe, Japan or North America. But we can safely guess that the response will follow the same model employed by other foreign companies who have been involved in quality or consumer safety flaps in China in the past, such as Johnson & Johnson (on the consumer side), HP in the tech industry, or luxury brands like Hugo Boss and Burberry (in 2006): assuaging consumer fears by (publicly) stepping up inspection standards, then taking proactive measures to increase consumer outreach (likely through both old and new media), and over time rebuilding their reputation for quality among Chinese consumers.", "Although a company with a deep perception of superior quality like Hermes \u2014 who will probably get something of a boost in reputation this year anyway, with the launch of their new China-built brand Shang Xia \u2014 won\u2019t have to work as hard as many other companies to rescue their image, quality controversies are not something any brand would want to deal with, especially in a market like China where consumer loyalties are fragile and one scandal can doom a company, or at least imperil its chances for future growth, in an instant.", ""]}, {"title": "Mainland Tourists Spent $42 Billion Overseas In 2009", "meta": "January 15, 2010", "paragraphs": ["Despite being outnumbered nearly three to one, outbound Chinese tourists outspent inbound tourists to China by $4 billion", "Chinese Media is reporting this week that outbound tourists from mainland China spent some $42 billion overseas (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) last year, outspending inbound international tourists for the first time.

As a result of a growing middle class, easing travel restrictions and tour group incentives, outbound tourism among mainland Chinese has grown at a double-digit pace, and retailers in Europe and Hong Kong in particular are likely hoping that 2010 brings even more free-spending mainlanders their way. According to the China Tourism Academy, this very well may be the case in the year ahead, as the academy has forecast that 54 million mainland tourists will head overseas in 2010, an increase of 15 percent year-on-year.", "As a China Daily article today points out, despite the huge discrepancy between the number of inbound tourists to China and outbound Chinese tourists, Chinese tourists tend to place primary emphasis on shopping, while international tourists in China go there for sightseeing. However, the article does point out that this follows a precedent in previous decades, when foreign tourists in the late 1970s and early 1980s (and, the case can be made, in the pre-WWII years) were comparatively wealthier and spent more per capita than the modern-day backpackers and middle class travelers who now make up the bulk of inbound tourists to China.", "From the article:", "\u201cChinese tourists have a different spending concept from others.
