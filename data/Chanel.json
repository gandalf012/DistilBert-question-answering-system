At Fendi, he introduced playfulness and wit into his collections and creations while carefully maintaining the core of the brand with its deep roots in Italian timelessness.", "Most importantly, Lagerfeld always managed to stay ahead of time. He was one of the first to capitalize on social media with his profound understanding of the power of images. He experimented with materials and colors and managed to keep relevancy of two-heritage brand even for millennials and Generation Z. And while many other designers struggled to understand how to address the highly-sophisticated taste of Chinese luxury consumers, and their desire to express themselves, Lagerfeld\u2019s creations became among the most sought-after among the world\u2019s most significant luxury consumers.", "It will not be an easy transition for both brands after such a loss. Looking back at history, Chanel took a nosedive after Coco\u2019s passing. Hence, bringing the right talent on board will be crucial.

How much of it is pre-planned?", "I would say that it is about 80 percent. The only reason for this is because the show is driven by sponsorships, so we have to be at certain places, like the mall.

The girls I find have to have a good story. They want to start their own business, they have a mind of their own, and they know what they want. It\u2019s not just a girl who happens to be rich and pretty. Of course, that helps. What really tells a story is that they want to do their own business and exploring what that is like. It\u2019s giving a different way for people to see the fuerdai. In the community, the fuerdai has had a really, really bad reputation in the past little while, with all the news reporting about the crashed Lamborghinis, Ferraris, whatever. But, there\u2019s rich kids in Canada, and they\u2019re called the trust fund kids. There\u2019s a lot of trust fund kids who blow their money on cocaine and partying. But, they don\u2019t get such a bad rap. There are also trust fund kids that go on to become lawyers, stockbrokers, and things like that.

She had a lot of charisma, and she had a lot of personality. She was starting her own activewear line and all this stuff. Things like that unfortunately happen, and the case is for the courts.

They have to have a great education and are trying to figure out their lives. That\u2019s the fun part\u2014figuring things out. If they knew everything already, it\u2019s not fun anymore, in my entertainment sense. Number two is of course they have to have wealth as it goes along with the name. We look at where they go party, where they like to eat, where they like to travel, what they carry, what their favorite brands are. That\u2019s how we go about it. I mean, do I go look at their bank accounts? That\u2019s not my business\u2014I don\u2019t need to look at that. All of that shows through their everyday life. The details will show how affluent they are, and that\u2019s how we go about it. Do they have more than most? I would have to say they would have to have more than many.

And from the consumer perspective, has this move been beneficial for Chanel? What other dynamics should we be considering?", "Some brands quickly made similar pricing adjustments, following Chanel\u2019s lead. Prada, for example, lowered pricing in China but decided to keep Europe pricing unchanged given weak domestic demand there. Burberry hinted at an imminent change similar to Chanel\u2019s, stating that it was keeping a close watch on exchange rate variations. Most, however, have been more cautious. Kering has taken a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach while LVMH has categorically stated that unified exchange rates (consistent pricing across markets) was not a strategy that they espoused, as it does not allow flexibility for luxury brands.", "Unquestionably, a weaker euro caused the already sizable price differential between Europe and China to soar even higher. Goods in some cases were 60 percent more expensive in China than they were in Europe. That differential still exists, albeit to a lesser degree, between China and other markets. Japan and South Korea in particular\u2014two of the most important destinations for Chinese tourists\u2014are choice destinations for luxury shoppers.

Reaching a high of 1.04 in March, the dollar has now lost almost 9 percent against the euro, pricing currently at 1.14. Where the dollar will settle is uncertain, although the euro is not expected to strengthen significantly given the current expansionary monetary policy of the ECB. Nonetheless, the correction has been significant in a very short time.", "Yet with respect to China, there is another side of the equation that many firms have underestimated: the renminbi (RMB). The assumption that China\u2019s currency will remain resolutely stable is one that has recently been questioned. China still has immense assets at its disposal, but with a housing bubble, a slowing economy, and whispers of increasing capital flight, absolute stability of its currency cannot be guaranteed. A devaluation of the RMB could be tremendously negative for luxury firms, particularly those that that are already overextended in China. Stay tuned.", "Currencies aside, another key development\u2014which may potentially change the dynamics for many luxury brands\u2014was the recent crackdown by China\u2019s State Council on gray market imports. The Council recently ordered more transparent and consistent tax collection while increasing seizures of counterfeit products. At the same time, the Council has requested a reduction in import duties by July in order to stimulate local demand (which has been weak). Which products and how much of a reduction will apply has not yet been announced.", "But the bigger question is whether a reduction in price in China would release the genie in the bottle, stimulating local demand and delivering better performance from Chinese business units. It\u2019s unlikely that this alone will change the behavior of the Chinese consumer, and their penchant for buying luxury abroad. Price is just one factor among many that drive purchasing decisions. Service, trust, experience, and perceived prestige also drive Chinese consumers to want to purchase overseas at brands\u2019 countries of origin. Even with a 20 percent price hike in Europe or a 20 percent decrease in China, multiple factors still make it more attractive for Chinese consumers to purchase overseas. And it is possible that it might backfire, eroding the perceived value of a brand.", "There is some indication that this may be the case after Chanel\u2019s price adjustment. In May of 2015, China Luxury Advisors conducted a sentiment analysis across Chinese social media platforms to measure and observe the reaction of Chinese consumers to Chanel\u2019s announcement. Discussion was lively, and a hashtag appeared on Weibo equivalent to #Chanelpricedecrease. While about 40 percent of consumers spoke positively of the price decrease, close to 60 percent had a negative reaction to the decrease.

Outside the museum, a long line of people waited to take a look at [Louis Vuitton\u2019s] \u201cVoyages\u201d exhibition. When asked whether they thought the exhibition was too crassly commercial, one respondent said it\u2019s to be expected, since a luxury brand is involved. Among the visitors lined up were several art students. \u201cWe major in design,\u201d one said, \u201cso we feel this [exhibition] is a rare chance to learn about the way brands combine craftsmanship with business, since there aren\u2019t many Chinese companies that do that.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Bulgari\u2019s recent exhibition at the National Museum of China", "Some industry insiders, when asked if the NMC\u2019s Louis Vuitton exhibition is too commercialized, said it\u2019s understandable for the museum to organize this type of show. Still, some added, the museum cannot ignore its social responsibilities. Many of us have failed to distinguish between art and culture exhibitions, which cultural scholar Pei Yu says are two distinct types of shows. As a museum, Pei Yu suggested, the National Museum of China should not only display exhibitions focused on cultural heritage, but needs to balance it with art exhibitions. Many Chinese brands with long historical pedigrees, such as Quanjude (\u5168\u805a\u5fb7) and Goubuli (\u72d7\u4e0d\u7406) have been included in museum exhibitions, Pei noted, so foreign brands like Louis Vuitton and Cartier, which often date back hundreds of years, can also do so.", "While these luxury-focused exhibitions might not be to the taste of every museum-goer in China, as we pointed out this past May, they\u2019re perhaps unavoidable.

These local fashion conglomerates have steadily transformed domestic fashion on the mainland, but independent designers are truly raising the industry\u2019s profile and reputation globally. In cases where corporations like Alibaba and JD.com have provided a platform for the smaller designers, the impact is only raised.

This is hardly surprising, as China currently accounts for more than 30 percent of all global luxury sales. This trend has been gaining momentum since the 2000s but has mushroomed over the last couple of years as more brand names venture into the Chinese market. Who can forget Fendi\u2019s iconic show on the Great Wall of China in 2007? This was followed by Herm\u00e8s\u2019 memorable show in Shanghai\u2019s World Financial Centre in 2008 and Armani\u2019s seminal One Night In Beijing show, which was watched by over 1,000 guests in 2012.", "While platforms like the Shanghai International Fashion Showcase \u2014 an event helmed by the man who made Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s Great Wall show a reality, Terence Chu \u2014 offer traditional venues where brands can present their collections during Shanghai Fashion Week, these days, many prefer to go it alone. The latest brand to announce it will show in China is British luxury giant Burberry, which will show its Fall 2020 collection in Shanghai on April 23. Last year, Valentino, Prada, and Dior all chose to produce solo runway shows in China, and even sportswear lines are making this leap (American brand Under Armour held an event at the Imperial Ancestral Temple of Beijing in 2017.)", "It\u2019s a trend that has firmly taken hold, regardless of the city, since these shows provide direct access to the world\u2019s largest fashion market (as an example, China now provides Valentino with roughly 30 percent of its global business). And while the spectacle and drama associated with these fashion shows have not waned, they\u2019re no longer staged as spectacles in their own right, rather they are strategically-produced attempts to earn shares of this valuable market.", "Thus, in this current landscape, stakeholder interests have shifted due to increased domestic luxury consumption. Government policies that encourage this shift in spending have left Western companies scrambling to find new and authentic ways to avoid sales losses. For many, this has meant refocusing on the Chinese market. To ensure names like Burberry remain relevant with existing Chinese fans as domestic competition heats up, it makes sense for fashion houses to showcase inside mainland China.

Moreover, ensuring you have Chinese designers and creatives as part of your team is your best chance of making sure you get it right and can develop a true understanding of Chinese heritage.\u201d Indeed, repeated miscalculations in content and the reactions it produces could be sidestepped by giving on-the-ground teams more power to create legitimate brand messages.", "A commitment that evolves", "According to Javier Cavier, Senior Director at the marketing firm Ipos, an amount of evolution in the market is necessary. \u201cIf you look historically behind the location of shows, they were driven by three main factors: They were aspirational cities within fashion like Milan, designers were based there, and they were home to an influential industry,\u201d he says. But when it comes to China, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. \u201cIdeally, the long-term desire to develop a close relationship with an audience should be on a local level,\u201d adds Cavier. \u201cDesigners started with digital livestreaming from Western fashion weeks, and now, they step up to a physical presence. Plus, these shows are market-specific.\u201d", "For brand activations in the Chinese market, the message to audiences should be clear: We value you, and we want to connect with you, but this needs to be carried out consistently over time.", "Ample locations to choose from", "China has no shortage of destinations for shows, and while most companies choose to set their brand\u2019s standard in Shanghai or Beijing, but other cities are starting to emerge as important destinations. Chanel, for one, chose to stage its Cruise 2018 collection in Chengdu. Cavier outlines the reasons behind show location choices, saying, \u201cIn China, the separation between affluence and influence is very different. The two don\u2019t come together in the same way as they might in other countries.\u201d", "Take Chenyang in the Hunan province, for example. Cavier points out that the city was part of \u201cold China\u201d 20 years ago, but like many other second-tier and third-tier cities, it now has a lot of financial wealth. \u201cWestern houses can\u2019t necessarily do shows there as inhabitants can buy, but they can\u2019t necessarily influence,\u201d he says. \u201cHangzhou, on the other hand, home to Alibaba, might work, but [brands should] think a little harder about choices outside the capitols.\u201d", "This only adds fuel to the idea that Western brands must be ready to match domestic conglomerates and go deeper into the country to make their mark on the Chinese market.", "", "Boosted engagement and visibility", "When combining a physical runway and an online platform, Emma Sharley, CEO of the strategic marketing and branding consultancy Sharley Consulting, describes the nuances that brands should employ. \u201cFashion shows generate invaluable engagement for new and established luxury groups,\u201d she says. \u201cIn addition to the physical runway experience, brands are offering added consumer access by tapping into China\u2019s vast digital platforms. This allows fashion shows to reach a new level of sophistication, engage both discerning luxury buyers and consumers through exquisite and immersive experiences, and appeal to their underlying passion for the new.\u201d", "As part of last year\u2019s runway show, Valentino created a Mini Program on WeChat that displayed an array of content ranging from showpieces to celebrity outfits.

But get it wrong, and you risk being seen as patronizing or not truly understanding China.\u201d He continues, adding that cultural elements must be included based on design merit rather than just commercial expediency, as those maneuvers are \u201coften transparent and rightly derided.\u201d", "Being authentic", "For Cavier, brand leaders need to tread carefully in general when in China. \u201cThere is often a backlash when entities are seen as pandering to the wishes of the Chinese Government,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balancing act, but ask yourself: Can they be aspirational in the market but also be absolutely upfront and above board? So many things can be misconstrued by an audience that can take sentiments to new levels.\u201d", "We have seen how many ill-judged luxury strategies can damage reputations. Dior managed to bounce back from its recent faux pas relatively quickly and with little harm done thanks to some insightful measures. Cavier\u2019s suggestions for countering unexpected issues are simple: connect locally, be careful, and act cautiously. Due to what he calls \u201cidiocracies in the market,\u201d the way companies articulate their brand activations in China must be very specific. Accordingly, they can be \u201cirreverent, creative, and push boundaries, but there are limits.\u201d", "Choosing the right online tech partners", "Claudia Verbost, Commercial Director of the China-focused marketing and e-commerce agency AgencyChina, confirms that the big e-commerce giants \u2014 including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance \u2014 are all fighting to win over Western luxury companies. \u201cOnline is so crucial in China,\u201d she states. \u201cTencent is making more attractive WeChat programs and drops, while Alibaba\u2019s Luxury Pavillion continues to impress, along with other initiatives.\u201d\u00a0 While runway shows will undoubtedly benefit from these alignments, according to Verbost, an important question remains: \u201cWhich platform is the best for your brand?\u201d", "Making mistakes offline will affect a brand\u2019s online decisions \u2014 if not now then down the line. Burberry is collaborating with Tencent in Shenzhen to open a \u201csocial retail store\u201d while Prada has chosen to go it alone by launching their own e-commerce shop. And while there\u2019s risk in choosing a platform, Verbost admits that any choice is ultimately a massive opportunity.", "Facing sustainability concerns head-on", "Given the current climate crisis, the thought of another luxury brand flying across the world to present a runway show sits uneasily with many consumers. Yet, the situation shouldn\u2019t be seen in black-and-white terms. Arthur suggests that, in time, issues like this will become a key consideration as sustainability becomes less siloed. \u201cRight now brands need to react to a shifting landscape and reach more consumers through any means possible,\u201d he notes. \u201cOpening more stores is no longer the easiest route to market, hence the physical show can boost growth. But we know there is a huge amount of environmental impact from shows. There is a carbon footprint, but you\u2019d hope these people are on the ground [in China] already, and I\u2019d imagine they will try to offset this.\u201d", "Brooke Roberts-Islam, a fashion tech and sustainability innovator, says that there are additional areas \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d where brands can look to be more ethical. \u201cThere are other areas that need to be targeted, sampling in design for one, he states. \u201cThere\u2019s an amount of waste on carbon emissions associated with that, and I\u2019d be interested to see how that stacks up against flights.\u201d", "Staying ahead of rapidly shifting trends", "Verbost, who has offices located in both Europe and China, adds that brands should also take heed of the speed factor in China. \u201cThe market requires quick movement,\u201d she states, \u201cso the fact that luxury companies are only stepping up their runway shows now, alongside the fact that China still isn\u2019t the first location but a secondary add-on, proves they\u2019re still too slow.\u201d She wonders if these big juggernauts can adapt to the needs of a post-90s generation, particularly when it seems like millennials are focusing on local independent designers. \u201cHaving only lived through the years in which China was experiencing double-digit growth and worldwide success, the Post-90s generation is proud to be Chinese and therefore also proud of the Chinese luxury lines that the country has to offer,\u201d she adds.", "Whether or not Western brands can move fast enough to stay up-to-date and on-trend over the next couple of years will likely indicate where mainland Chinese consumers will be spending their money."]}, {"title": "Unlocking the Potential of China\u2019s Elite International Shopper", "meta": "January 26, 2020", "paragraphs": ["The UN predicted that 100 million Chinese will become travelers by the year 2020, but that number was reached in 2016 \u2014 four years ahead of schedule.

That includes safaris but also unique and rustic castles in the French or Italian countryside that are often hard to find or access.", "Aside from mistakenly focusing on the infrequent travel shopper segment, marketers also wrongly assume that Chinese travelers still prefer to sightsee in groups.

Interestingly enough, both cities are governed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d structure, so one might expect the same revolutionary vibe from Macau that Hong Kong is displaying. History, however, has played an important role in Macau\u2019s development. While both cities were European colonies, one was governed by a crippled Portuguese power while the other was the crown jewel of the all-powerful British Empire.", "Over the years, the British government poured resources into Hong Kong and encouraged liberalism and the pursuit of equality and individual liberties. But Macau\u2019s situation was far more complex, given the complications that arose from the 1887 Lisbon Protocol. Many historians, in fact, argue that China and Portugal shared sovereignty of Macau even before the 20th century.

Beijing and Shanghai\u2019s fashion weeks have a history of 22 and 17 years, respectively, but a host of regions using fashion as a quick and easy way to self-promote often fail to stabilize their events, and many disappear as fast as they appear.", "Chengdu Fashion Week, for example, launched a six-day event in 2018 with shows from local and international brands like Stella McCartney, yet it failed to return in 2019. Local retailer, Zhuo Ai, founder of the boutique Dressing for Fun, says Chengdu was both in \u201can experimental stage\u201d and lacking the investment needed for a long-term vision. \u201cFor brands in the local area, alternative fashion weeks are useful for support, although I think there are not that many local designers in these cities,\u201d she adds.", "Moreover, while some designers and press people often favor international fashion weeks over local domestic ones, others simply ignore alternative fashion weeks entirely or feel too inexperienced to take part in them. Another stumbling block for committees is their failure to attract the locally-born or based independent talent that helps to add a \u201ccool\u201d factor. Yet there are still other gaps: Only Shanghai Fashion Week hosts a public-facing fashion weekend (following their official event), China lacks a men\u2019s fashion week despite growing interest in the sector, and the country\u2019s first Couture week only launched last month. Overall, so many different fashion weeks run by different organizations make one wonder if a siloed, disjointed system is even feasible.", "Yet, despite these obstacles, China\u2019s newer fashion weeks present an opportunity not only for local brands but international ones. Indeed, with a forecasted consumer expenditure of 1.2 trillion yuan for 2025, foreign players need to double down on the market. Getting ahead in China and adopting more localized strategies that surround domestic fashion hubs will put a brand in a strong position to capitalize on China\u2019s consumer spending. Whether a brand is local or international, there\u2019s one message: Ignore the domestic market at your peril.", "Creative director Rocky Liang of The Mix Place, a creative destination from Guangzhou brand Exception de Mixmind, says that China\u2019s fashion weeks are only now taking their shape. \u201cException de Mixmind has featured on Xiamen\u2019s schedule and has held several events during Shanghai Fashion Week, too,\u201d Liang says. \u201cThese are more of a platform to showcase brand strength to gain further exposure, and where you find a promising fashion week you might find China\u2019s next big fashion capital.\u201d With this optimism in mind, Jing Daily\u00a0looks at a selection of China\u2019s fashion weeks, highlighting key opportunities for brands:", "When: Yearly, March and October", "Overview: For now, one thing is clear: Shanghai Fashion Week is China\u2019s most recognized fashion week. Over 17 years, it has built a credible, twice-yearly event that features hundreds of brands on runways, at parties, and in forums, while selling to thousands via showrooms and tradeshows. In response to how she keeps ahead of the competition, Madame Lu, the Vice Secretary-General of Shanghai Fashion Week, says, \u201cWe always do things that lead the industry. We haven\u2019t copied what the big four do but have managed to create our own ecosystem here in Shanghai.\u201d", "Why it matters to China: As Madame Lu explains, the organizing committees\u2019 focus is making Shanghai a fashion destination that is \u201cattractive to the international industry and also benefits the domestic market and independent talents.\u201d Indeed, the event\u2019s success lies in its ability to tap these local, emerging talents, which are often overlooked by other fashion weeks. It\u2019s a strategy that is paying off, and these designers are now bringing global attention to the city. Moreover, the big four are now looking to Shanghai for innovation: In September 2019, the British Fashion Council started selling tickets to London Fashion Week \u2014 copying a pioneering move introduced by Shanghai.", "Key brand opportunity: This fashion week is a global-facing event with a growing reputation among domestic buyers, making it an indispensable landmark for brands wanting to crack the Chinese market.

It has also brought with it a selection of American brands to participate, including Leanne Marshall, Cynthia Rowley, and Bibhu Mohapatra.", "Why it matters to China: Shenzhen has been uniquely developed for manufacturing and trade, and as one of the first Chinese cities open to the West (along with neighboring Hong Kong), it has become a vital hub of design innovation and production. IMG\u2019s Jennifer Taylor, VP of Global Consulting and Business Development, points out that, over the years, the city has been responsible for a tremendous amount of domestic manufacturing, and many global brands now source manufacturing in Shenzhen.", "Key brand opportunity: International brands can benefit in many ways from this event by making local manufacturing connections, building their network for distribution to the Chinese market, or increasing brand awareness. And while the Chinese marketplace presents some unique complexities for Western brands, the lure of potential growth undoubtedly attracts. \u201cShowing at Shenzhen Fashion Week and, therefore, participating in the Chinese retail landscape is a great introduction to the market,\u201d Taylor adds.", "When: Yearly, April and November", "Overview: Guangzhou Fashion Week, which was founded in 2003, is organized by the Guangzhou Fashion Designers Association and supported by the city\u2019s municipal commission of commerce.

For me personally, it was an opportunity to see the variety of fabric and textile factories being produced here at different scales.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: A tier-1 city and China\u2019s third-largest, Guangzhou is located close to both Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Like these cities, Guangzhou\u2019s long-held position as a production base means it can also offer brands access to large fabric wholesalers and markets. And while the event has yet to receive much global recognition, it\u2019s developing international ties by inviting brands from outside of China. Lawlor, who showed alongside several brands from the UK and Italy that were invited by Guangzhou fashion week, is optimistic about the event, saying, \u201cI think the international brands built some stable connections and the industry made orders. The level of investment was impressive and there are opportunities there \u2014 you just need to hunt for them.\u201d", "When: Yearly, March and October", "Overview: Beijing\u2019s China Fashion Week is the country\u2019s most established and longest-running fashion week. However, it has failed to make the international impact of its industry rival in Shanghai. First organized by the China Fashion Association in 1997, the fashion week has bet on China\u2019s domestic winners over its 22-year history through a combined total of 200-plus shows and events, including brands like Ne-Tiger, Yaying, and Uooyaa. This lineup includes brands from other domestic cities like Dalien alongside non-Chinese brands from over 20 countries.", "Why it matters to China: After the loss of international sponsor Mercedes Benz, China Fashion Week has struggled to attract attention both inside and outside of China. Now, having recently partnered with WWD China, it\u2019s showing a new effort to amplify its global reputation. As one of the last fashion weeks on the circuit, most buyers will have allocated budgets by the time it takes place, which means most brands showing there are dependent on the attendance of national buyers. However, given the volume of China\u2019s domestic market, that still equates to big business, and both the event and the China Fashion Association can look to increase its dominance on their home turf.", "Beijing is also home to Fashion Now: a separately-organized alternative showcasing platform that runs before China Fashion Week. It appeals specifically to niche, independent designers and the 14th edition will take place in late March 2020.", "Key brand opportunity: According to an organization insider, this fashion week offers participating brands unrivaled opportunities for press coverage and media exposure, as Beijing is the unofficial home of China\u2019s media. The roughly 500 media companies in attendance can propel an unknown brand into the mainland\u2019s consciousness in its first season. Similarly to other fashion weeks, China Fashion Week hosts trade shows, B2B events, and forums, and it also organizes the China Fashion Awards, which connects and honors industry professionals.", "When: Yearly, December", "Overview: Xiamen has become a haven for fashion design in recent years. As the home of brands ranging from large conglomerates like Anta Sports and Septwolves to young, independent designers such as Ms Min and Sankuanz, it\u2019s fitting that Xiamen would want its own fashion week. Established by the municipal government, the condensed event focuses on local brands like Jiwenbo and The MSLAN with a peppering of international talent.", "Why it matters to China: The event targets highly localized brands, but it invited brands from Beijing and Shanghai to showcase this year. Despite these efforts, Xiamen Fashion Week is still decidedly irrelevant to younger, designer brands like Sankuanz, Ms Min, and Deepmoss, all of which are local yet disengaged. Dido Liu, the designer behind Deepmoss, has been showing seasonally at Shanghai Fashion Week since 2015 and suggests the event needs more time. \u201cI think for Xiamen, it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cI think they have big plans, but for now, other fashion weeks are more advanced. But, it can\u2019t be built in one day.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: The event bills itself as an \u201cauthoritative platform to promote China\u2019s fashion index and new trends.\u201d What this means precisely isn\u2019t clear. However, amid its plethora of B2B showcases, forums, talks, and events, Xiamen Fashion Week offers, at the very least, an outlet for brands to connect with media and potential buyers.", "When: September 2020", "Overview: Centrestage is Hong Kong\u2019s official fashion week and is supported by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC). Not to be confused with the city\u2019s textile trade fair, Hong Kong Fashion Week, Centrestage has been running since 2016 and is based at the commercial Hong Kong Exhibition Centre. There it operates a trade-show/showroom experience that offers a bounty of fashion shows from local and invited designers that are primarily sourced from mainland China and Asia. It also plays host to the environmental NGO Redress Design Award, industry talks, and many knowledge-sharing initiatives.", "Why it matters to China: Centrestage aims to be the best fashion week in Asia and for Asia. The event invites established brands like Korea\u2019s Juun J and Japan\u2019s Facetasm but is also striving to become a hotbed for new talent. For Jarno Leppanen\u2019s emerging independent menswear brand Ka Wa Key, which is based in Hong Kong and London, the strategy is working. \u201cIt\u2019s a good combination of east meets west,\u201d he says. \u201cCenterstage is a brilliant gateway to the Asian market. I think it\u2019s a really useful platform for Hong Kong designers, and even though it competes with NYFW time-wise, it still manages to stand out as its own interesting event.\u201d", "Key brand opportunity: With 50 offices globally, the HKTDC organizes a range of buying missions. Alongside local luxury retailers, close to 7,000 buyers from 74 countries and regions visited in 2019. For brands such as FFixxed Studios, the main attraction of the event is access to these buyers. \u201cThe year we took part, the organizers had really strong buyers, and due to the concise selection of talent, you are guaranteed they will look at your collection,\u201d says FFixxed co-founder Fiona Lau. She also praised the production of the event and accurate brand representation, which is likely due to the HKTDC\u2019s 50 years of event experience.", "When: Nov 19 \u2013 21, 2019", "Overview: The first dedicated couture fashion week in China is a collaboration between the Jinan Municipal Government and the Asian Couture Federation to help promote the local textile and clothing industry of Shandong province.

Dr. Frank Cintamani, Founding President of the Asian Couture Federation, affirms this, stating, \u201cAs an on-going initiative, we hope to create a singular platform, giving Asia a much needed focal point for the Asian couture industry, and, as such, this affords a unique opportunity to create new markets for couturiers in China.\u201d Also, its student-focused forum, aimed at demystifying and explaining the business of couture, adds value to the event.", "Key brand opportunity: The appeal of homegrown couture designers is rising in China, as celebrities and high-profile clients alike are turning to names like Pei and Grace Chen when making investment purchases. VIPs and mostly Beijing-based media attended the event, and it was broadcast on CCTV to over 600 million viewers, which means access to a stream of potential new clients.

Meanwhile, influencers contributed to 36 percent ($2.1 million) of overall MIV for the event. Chinese celebrity Hu Bing, who made an appearance at Feng Chen Wang, was the top-ranking influencer, bringing in $83,000 worth of MIV.", "For many Chinese designers, starting at LFWM is often ideal because of familiarity. London can become a second home after finishing their studies, visa permitting. Taiwanese designer Yi-Ling Kuo of 1X1 has been living in London for eight years, and LFWM is, therefore, an obvious platform for her to show her technical knit brand in its third season. \u201cI feel inspired here,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are open-minded here, and being based in London, I\u2019m just used to how it works.\u201d", "Feng Chen Wang FW20 Runway.

But moves like these are generally restrained. As a buyer, Petersson explains that schedule-hopping from the bigger brands can cause issues for younger labels. \u201cIt gets more complicated when one of the bigger brands goes off and decides to show in another city whilst one city is already starting to show,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is sometimes detrimental to the younger brands that tend to get the slots on the first or last day and are more likely to be affected by this.\u201d", "She suggests it can be good for younger brands to experiment, though, as this not only adds excitement to a schedule but has practical benefits. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that young designers are trying out new cities to get a feel for where they are best suited, she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s especially beneficial where the label is established in an \u2018off-schedule\u2019 city like Shanghai, where you won\u2019t benefit from the full force of international buyers.\u201d", "Backstage at 8on8 FW20.

For Chinese menswear, it\u2019s like a test to get feedback.

Xander Zhou, Sanquanz, and Sean Suen were all early recipients of their support (the latter two have moved on from the London show). This season, the GQ China Presents platform supported 8ON8\u2019s \u201cWait Rose!\u201d collection, which was a play on the U.K.\u2019s Waitrose supermarket. \u201c8ON8 will stay in London, it works for us here,\u201d explains designer Li Gong. \u201cIt\u2019s the most creative place for me, and I\u2019ve got a connection [to it].\u201d Last season, 8ON8 showed at Pitti, which Li admires, but \u201cLondon pips it for creativity.\u201d", "Backstage at Pronounce FW20.

Ka Wa Key has shown in London, Finland, New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai thus far. \u201cLondon has a great atmosphere, but it\u2019s getting smaller. It has fewer designers, buyers, press, and interest. This year, we go back to New York in February. It\u2019s a great city with great energy,\u201d he states.", "Like Ka Wa Key, most Chinese designers on the LFWM schedule featured women\u2019s looks as part of their collections in London, further threatening the stability of schedules. London\u2019s incubator Fashion East recently dropped its prestigious MAN platform, adding it into its women\u2019s sponsorship. Moreover, fashion weeks in Asia are usually mixed-gender. Former GQ Presents recipient, the US-based Private Policy, has gone one step further and switched to a womenswear schedule, presenting at NYFW in February. \u201cWe want to try a different fashion week schedule and keep exploring genderless fashion,\u201d explains co-designer, Siying Qu. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to limit buyers or consumers but want them to feel comfortable.\u201d And while they are now, admittedly, \u201cfirmly embedded\u201d in New York, past slots at LFWM were useful. \u201cIt was a way to have more presence in Europe and open up the market with some shows,\u201d Qu adds. \u201cWe met with retailer Selfridges and now they carry us. London men\u2019s is very vibrant and exciting, and the city is still on the brand\u2019s radar. Our next plan for London will not be during fashion week, rather, we are looking for opportunities to present differently, like in a popup or a store.\u201d", "While it certainly affords emerging designers the freedom to experiment, according to Tomorrow\u2019s Lee, schedule-hopping is not ideal. \u201cI think for some established brands it\u2019s interesting to show in different places. But for young emerging designers, it can be confusing to the industry when a brand keeps swapping around.\u201d Since launching with GQ China, Xander Zhou has consistently shown at LFWM. This season, his conceptual designs exploring multiverses and inclusivity showcased a level of maturity that Lee considers integral to having a solid base. \u201cNow, after four or five years, we really know the brand,\u201d Lee says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good model for young, emerging Chinese designers to adopt.\u201d", "Xander Zhou FW20 Runway.

Ka Wa Key suggested it wasn\u2019t ideal for them, while the London-based duo Dan Shan, who are former regulars at LFWM, opted for a break, instead opting for a showroom at Pitti Immagine Uomo and a show in Shanghai. The Guangzhou-born Danxia Liu, one half of the label explains, saying, \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a better timeline to show later. Also, if you show in March or April, you have more chances of standing out. The buyers have a fresh memory.

Standing out is vital, and Asian fashion weeks have a much lower MIV impact than London: An internal report by Launchmetrics stated that across Western channels, SS20 could be valued as follows: $8.2 million in Tokyo, $5.6 million in Seoul, and $2.1 million in Shanghai. As Yu suggests, showing internationally carries \u201cprestige\u201d for Chinese designers, and in this regard, designers need to break out and compete on the global stage. \u201cChinese consumers appreciate designers who are gaining recognition abroad and are keen to support and celebrate their success,\u201d she adds. \u201cChinese designers could make this a key part of their marketing strategy.\u201d", "On the ground level, brands like Dan Shan are writing a new rulebook by being flexible. Liu is confident that when choosing where to show, brands don\u2019t have to follow pre-existing routes. \u201cThese days, it simply doesn\u2019t really matter where you show or even what time.

At the same time, wealth is growing at a staggering rate in lower-tier cities, and residents of these places are catching up with the consumer lifestyles of bigger cities. But despite positive evaluations, luxury brands have avoided aggressive expansions in lower-tier cities.

Broadly speaking, limited or selective distribution is a good luxury strategy, but in the age of counterfeits when consumer perception is changing and buyers are less resistant to fakes, this might be a counterproductive strategy.", "One of the most fundamental concepts in B2B marketing is designing the right product and offering it through the right strategy to the right consumer. But if luxury brands are using a selective distribution strategy for lower-tier cities, they force buyers to find alternative ways to get their Chanel and Herm\u00e8s accessories. The disadvantage of this phenomenon is that it boosts the growth of the underground economy. So, in reality, this strategy penalizes both the consumer and the luxury brand.", "There isn\u2019t just a war on fakes and replicas \u2014 there\u2019s also one on Daigous and unauthorized resellers.

Given that top online retailers like Alibaba show no signs of stopping, Western brands should use their physical presence to compete against them, and international retailers could create value by using modern technologies and data-driven customer insights.", "Considering that tier-1 cities are reaching high-saturation levels in luxury retail, international brands need to focus on virgin or dormant markets where competition is lower. This is especially true for the more affordable premium American brands (e.g.: Michael Kors, Coach) that have been penalized by tier-1 consumers because of President Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China. Since their luster is fading, these brands need to develop a strategy that brings them back into the spotlight. Expanding their offerings to energized smaller cities is less costly and more effective than moving their operations abroad or chasing new markets around the world.", "There is no question that lower-tier cities present opportunities that international brands can no longer ignore. At the same time, the dangers of losing legitimacy and brand identity are also certainly real. That\u2019s why Western retailers need to estimate the long-term effects of their expansion strategy to predict when and in which cities to expand.

While designing China-exclusive products for Chinese New Year or Chinese Valentine\u2019s Qixi have become a common practice, this is a rather new approach for Western luxury brands, and some of their efforts may have exceeded the level of Chinese consumer education.

Cultural Collaborations One of the beauty marketing trends in 2020 we will talk about is cultural collaborations. China\u2019s domestic beauty brands are thinking outside the box with unexpected crossovers and limited-edition partnerships in the cultural and artistic sectors that are paying off, striking a chord with culturally savvy Chinese consumers. In one memorable case, Perfect Diary partnered with the Discovery Channel for the release of a 12-color eyeshadow palette decorated with wild animals. The line, called Explorer, went viral on social media, attracting more than 100,000 pre-orders and even more sold in each of the six months after its initial release.", "Earlier this year, Perfect Diary also worked with The Met ahead of the Met Gala for a lipstick series, using the royal portraits inside the museum as inspiration.

Presented under the tagline \u201creshaping brand culture through art,\u201d the exhibition was well-received by advertising commentators and featured actresses Tang Wei and Ayase Haruka posing for photographer Zhong Ling.", "Partnership possibilities are endless, as long as they connect with an institution or a popular television series that has people talking. For example, Marie Dalgar partnered with the CCTV documentary series \u201cNational Treasure\u201d for a limited-edition lipstick and built a well-earned reputation among consumers for championing Chinese heritage. Collaborations don\u2019t even need to be in the realm of high culture as long as it will reach the masses in popular spaces\u2014similarly to Cheetos\u2019 beauty-focused marketing campaign in Western social media circles, China\u2019s Marie Dalgar worked with KFC in 2017 for advertising campaigns that generated 12 million RMB in revenue over three days and 1.4 million visits to Marie Dalgar\u2019s Tmall store.", "2. Product Launches around Trending Topics In a similar vein, one of the beauty marketing trends you don\u2019t want to miss is that beauty brands are leveraging trending conversation topics and memes for marketing campaigns. Everyone creates special products to tie in with Chinese holidays\u2014above all, for Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival\u2014and e-commerce events like Singles\u2019 Day. Now, brands are riding on a broader range of events and conversations, hoping they can attract some of the spotlights for themselves. In recent years, a number of brands have released Spring Festival campaigns engaging sincerely with some of the serious issues and dilemmas young people face around the holiday when tensions can run high with family visits. For example, SK-II\u2019s 2019 Spring Festival campaign addressed the pressure many unmarried Chinese women face when they return home.", "", "Exemplary case studies prove that brands can be bold and cross into new product categories in their collaborations. For example, Marie Dalgar teamed up with brewing giant Heineken and Tmall earlier this year to release a \u201cforgiveness\u201d gift box. The gift box was released on Tmall\u2019s \u201cFans Day\u201d to coincide with the European Champions\u2019 League soccer final, which Heineken sponsors. The hook: soccer lovers could give their partners a gift box to beg \u201cforgiveness\u201d and apologize for ignoring them while watching the final. \u201cWearing a green cap\u201d in Chinese means \u201cto cheat on your loved one\u201d\u2013in this case, with soccer. Two boxes were offered in \u201chis\u201d and \u201chers\u201d editions. One box featured green lipsticks in beer and green tea flavors, while the other contained limited-edition Champions\u2019 League bottles of Heineken.", "A tie-in like this allowed Marie Dalgar to piggyback on one of the world\u2019s biggest sporting occasions to inspire conversations about its lipsticks. Out of a limited edition run of 3,000 units, Marie Dalgar sold 1,000 units within 10 minutes. The campaign reached 62 million consumers online, with a total of 50 million engagements.", "Brands don\u2019t need to try to turn every trending topic into a discussion about themselves. A great social team may have the wit to score regular hits with a range of topics, but those who are too eager will look desperate, if not inappropriate. Instead, brands should start by combing the calendar for annual and upcoming events that align with their products or values. This could mean cultural and sporting events, awards shows, festivals, and concerts. It could mean paying attention to what\u2019s big in the culture, from celebrities, memes, and slang, to TV shows and movies. From there, it\u2019s all about getting creative and exploring what the brand can add to the discussion, how it can work with KOLs to do so, and how that can lead to conversions.", "3. Fresh Faces Several years after they first emerged, the first wave of \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d stars like Lu Han and Kris Wu are now household names. The enviable skin and fresh-faced appeal of the original xiaoxianrou stars mean they\u2019re still a ubiquitous presence in Chinese beauty advertising.

Creative New Retail Era Beauty brands are exploring new concepts in the space between traditional boutiques and online commerce. Marie Dalgar was the first beauty brand to launch a vending machine specifically for beauty products, but this approach has proved popular, and a number of other beauty brands have subsequently adopted the format.

Private Traffic is King Previously, we talked about how brands can leverage private traffic to gain more \u201cKey Opinion Customers\u201d (KOCs) and boost their ROI. This strategy is especially suited for the beauty category, where customers are often making repeat purchases and tend to have an unlimited amount of talking points, from questions about ingredients to tips on how to apply products. Perfect Diary is a model example of a brand that has capitalized on \u201cprivate traffic\u201d by cultivating thousands of devoted brand fans across hundreds of WeChat groups dedicated to fostering exclusive conversations and information around its products.", "Beauty brands shouldn\u2019t miss out on this opportunity. They can either initiate consumer communities on one-to-one messaging platforms like WeChat or QQ on their own or leave it to KOLs to form their own networks of KOCs around niche subjects. Sometimes, customers might start these communities on their own in the West, Glossier has a huge collection of brand fans on Reddit, some of whom pose genuine questions and share feedback around various products. Glossier ambassadors and influencers are also active in these circles, sharing creative makeup ideas using specific products like this face chart.", "The best part? If they\u2019re successful, the power of word of mouth amid these tight-knit, niche groups creates new customers and sales without the extra investment, helping brand campaigns go a lot further.", "6. Experiences Endure If any proof was needed, Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s \u201cBeauty Hotel\u201d pop-up last year showed the enduring power of experiential marketing, which is considered to be one of the top beauty marketing trends in 2020. A novel, imaginative and well-executed offline event can both bring a brand alive to new consumers, and reaffirm the brand\u2019s value to existing customers. Brands can now use live broadcasts to give online audiences a taste of the experience.", "Chanel\u2019s Coco Game Center has been a huge hit in Shanghai, Hong Kong and across other Asian markets over the past year, bringing together retro arcade games and exploration of Chanel\u2019s beauty products into one fun-focused package.", "", "In October, skincare brand La Mer created an immersive pop-up experience at Shanghai\u2019s Power Station of Art.

But the situation isn\u2019t as rosy as it seems.", "In a country where over 1 million influencers with over 10,000 social media followers are registered and 54 percent of young people born after 1995 said \u201cinfluencer\u201d was their most desired occupation, buyers have become increasingly exhausted by KOLs and influencers and are turning away from them. So going forward, how exactly can brands sell their products on Chinese social media channels without the help of influencers?", "\u201cHashtag\u201d was declared 2012\u2019s word of the year by the American Dialect Society and Twitter users generated over 125 million hashtags a day in 2017, so hashtag marketing should have incredible potential. Furthermore, hashtags are a way of telling an engaging story with just a few characters, and this resonates with younger consumers who have shorter attention spans (Gen Zers have an average attention span of 8 seconds as compared to millennials\u2019 12-second attention spans.)", "But what\u2019s equally important is how hashtags boost social media engagement and brand awareness (branded hashtags) while also helping social media users identify the strengths of a product. Weibo is all about hashtags, and luxury brands wanting to engage with Weibo users must create engaging hashtags. Tiffany & Co. and Coach (#whatisinyourcoachbag) are boosting their brands while marketing their products through catchy hashtags on Weibo. But hashtags have also become a powerful tool with the ability to cancel a brand\u2019s legacy in a matter of hours. According to Latin Fashion Week, the Weibo hashtag #DGTheGreatShowCancelled, which appeared after luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana canceled a planned fashion show due to criticism over an ad campaign that many Chinese perceived as racist, has been read 540 million times and mentioned in 74,000 discussions.", "Live chat is a big sales booster.

These collaborations proved to be a very successful formula for retailers in the West. Analysts, however, wondered if the performance and success of lower-priced collections could be replicated even in China.

To give an example, the Alexander Wang x H&M collaboration became an internet phenomenon in China but logistical complications turned fans against the retailer.", "Given possible missteps, should retailers promote high-low collaborations in China?", "Definitely, yes. China is a competitive market bestowed with the power of building or breaking international brands. However, the right business strategy can make all the difference. By way of example, the Uniqlo x KAWS collection created great desire among Chinese consumers.

The H&M x Moschino collaboration (2018) achieved equal success, creating a veritable hysteria in China.", "In both cases, the brands used brilliant marketing campaigns to appeal to the sensibilities of Chinese consumers.

Indeed, the concept of luxury has been extended to sneakers and hoodies and is no longer exclusive to haute-couture gowns or Birkin bags. Evidently, the democratization of fashion is favoring luxury-mass collections because buyers don\u2019t downgrade the collaborations to fast-fashion, but they see them as an extension of the luxury brand.", "Equally important, younger Chinese consumers of lesser means who seek the prestige of international brands will be drawn to such partnerships. Since they can\u2019t afford a Chanel tweed jacket, investing in a pair of trendy sneakers at a lower price point, or a T-shirt for RMB 99, is an affordable way to gain some social currency. It\u2019s safe to say that as long as label-obsessed youth continues to spend much of their income on designer apparel, established fashion designers will continue collaborating with fast-fashion retailers. In the end, this is a win-win situation. The fashion designer and luxury brand both win exposure, while buyers get label products that come at a much more affordable price point.", "2. Accessibility", "The market for luxury goods in China is defined by high costs and scarcity. In 2017, the Business of Fashion reported that China was the world\u2019s most expensive luxury market.

According to Luxe Digital, \u201c45% of middle-class consumers in Chinese tier 2 and tier 3 cities are interested in purchasing luxury goods, versus 37% in tier 1 cities.\u201d Naturally, scarcity pushes the performance and profits higher; thus, there is the possibility for luxury-mass collaborations to achieve greater success in smaller cities.", "3.

From the perspective of middle-class consumers, luxury-mass collaborations are similarly appealing alternatives since they create the same value but (usually) come at lower price points.

And, while Plum\u2019s $20 million Series B funding might seem minimal compared to The RealReal\u2019s $300 million IPO, market conditions in China suggest that Plum could now be on a similar trajectory to the one the breakout U.S. company took. With the rapid economic development of China through its expanding middle class, the second-hand luxury category, which has been undervalued years, is starting to look promising.", "Having raised a total of $58.4 million in six rounds of funding, Plum has seen steady growth, as investors continue to bet on the platform. But some voices are skeptical about the scale and profitability of the luxury resale business in China, while also finding some of the platform\u2019s procedures to be problematic. With challenges coming from both inside and outside the business, will Plum be able to step up and take the title of China\u2019s version of The RealReal?", "In China, consumer sentiment towards second-hand retail is shifting. While older generations attach a stigma to second-hand goods, younger generations are significantly more open to them. Meanwhile, an abundance of luxury goods located in the country is setting the stage for a prosperous second-hand market. For generations of Chinese, second-hand goods are associated with poverty and poor quality, particularly for Gen Xers and older millennials who have experienced the socioeconomic transition. However, younger millennials and Gen Zers who grew up in a relatively affluent environment weren\u2019t born with this stigma.", "Plum is selling popular vintage bags and jewelry from luxury brands like Chanel and Dior via collaborations with Japanese vintage retailers. Courtesy of Plum", "But the success of second-hand sales in China is not only limited by stigma; it also has underdeveloped market regulations to blame. Chinese consumers are always worried about the authenticity of pre-owned luxury goods on the market, as counterfeit sellers are rampant in the country. Fortunately, the battle against counterfeits has seen progress thanks to efforts from stakeholders that include luxury companies, local e-commerce businesses, and the Chinese government. Alibaba, teaming up with Richemont and Chinese law enforcement, is proving the country\u2019s determination to protecting intellectual property.", "Though China is one of the biggest luxury markets in the world, the secondary luxury market is underdeveloped, only making up 2 percent of the overall luxury market in 2018. There is substantial room for growth in China\u2019s market compared to the U.S. and Japan, which claim 31 percent and 28 percent, respectively. In 2018, pre-owned, high-end goods amounted to $1.7 billion (12.1 billion RMB) in China, according to the 2019 Chinese Second-hand Luxury Industry Report. It is still a modest number compared to the $6 billion US resale luxury market from 2018, but based on the fact that the yearly growth rate exceeded 20 percent over the last four years, the report anticipates an upgrading trend will continue.", "The growing acceptance of pre-owned goods and a more regular secondary market in China has prepared the country for Plum, but it\u2019s not enough to build up a mature trading chain without having the capability to speak to the domestic market. To make up for the supply deficiency during its initial stages, Plum is selling popular vintage bags and jewelry from luxury brands like Chanel and Dior via collaborations with Japanese vintage retailers. The supply from Japan not only enriches the inventory but also establishes the authenticity of merchandise on site. As Plum attracts many well-traveled Chinese consumers who are big fans of vintage luxury and frequent visitors to Japanese vintage stores, the platform should build up its reputation among experienced vintage shoppers. But for consumers who are new to the secondary market, the conditions and details of pre-owned items are their main concerns. Plum has thus incorporated a livestreaming feature as an efficient and powerful way to showcase items remotely. Consumers can interact with livestreaming hosts, ask for a detailed presentation, and even purchase the item while watching the livestream.", "It\u2019s the right time to break into the market, but the most critical issue awaiting Plum is how to drive sustainable circulation. Featuring a very similar consumer to business to consumer (C2B2C) model as The RealReal, Plum is positioned as an intermediate platform that connects consumers who exchange goods. Both sites aim at authenticating merchandise they receive from consignors while handling all sales processes, including photography, cataloging, pricing, stocking, and returns. They earn a certain percentage of consignors\u2019 commission fees for sustaining this operation.", "While the RealReal\u2019s commission structure consists of tiered commission rates based on the values of the items and their consignor loyalty program, Plum charges a 20 percent commission rate for all items across the board. The RealReal also only accepts luxury brands, but unlike Plum, offers consignors higher commission rates for higher-price items. By contrast, Plum\u2019s one-rate-fits-all policy is less compelling in motivating high-value merchandise consignments such as watches, jewelry, and high-priced handbags. Meanwhile, The RealReal delivers the message that \u201cthe more you consign the more you earn\u201d to clients through its VIP program. Though Plum features a privileged membership that offers extra discounts for shopping, the program cannot organically increase customer stickiness and has nothing to do with the supply side, which is the most important driver of the resale business.", "Plum must furnish clients with satisfying consignment experiences. Plum\u2019s one-option shipping fails to bring consignors an exclusive experience that is consistent with its high-end positioning. Consumers complain about the opaque evaluating process of Plum on social media and contend that \u201cit\u2019s a friendly pre-owned luxury shopping destination, but not really a fair place for trade-in.\u201d", "Given the positive future of the second-hand economy in China, there will be several competitors and partners who would like to earn a slice of that market share. Players who are interested in the lucrative market should collaboratively facilitate a transparent system that can earn clients\u2019 trust and educate the public about sustainable shopping the way The RealReal calculates and discloses how much the consumer can save by reselling. Undoubtedly, Chinese luxury consumers are ready for the secondary market, but the shopping and consigning experiences they expect are as high-end as the new goods they are used to purchasing. Investors should be careful about the current gap between consumers\u2019 expectations and the products/services that luxury recommerce sites provide. The question also needs to be asked if there are enough consignors and customers for this emerging secondhand market to take root in China. Time will tell."]}, {"title": "Will Chinese Consumers Forgive Dior?", "meta": "October 23, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Everything was going well.

While Dior did not explicitly say why this song was played, many in the Chinese community took it to be an extension of their recent apology.", "Some netizen thought the song choice was forced, stating that it was a simply a gimmick to appease Chinese consumers.

More forgiving netizens, meanwhile, took Dior\u2019s act as an example of a foreign brand \u201ctrying too hard\u201d to survive in China.

The prompt official response to the public played an important role in preventing the backlash from spreading more widely. However, a large population of netizens deemed the apology insincere and regarded it as a standard reaction, as they believed Dior has learned from previous brands\u2019 missteps to come up with a prompt official response to combat the clashes among netizens.

Netizens blame Dior\u2019s ambassadors for tolerating a brand that does not respect China and abandoning their integrity for money. One netizen ( TJ\u96c4) commented, \u201cNone of Dior\u2019s brand ambassador raised their voice regarding this misstep,\u201d and received over 200 likes.

A tight window for the two events gave the brand a limited time frame to decide how to move forward. And yet, Dior seemingly turned the runway show into an opportunity to further exhibit its attitude on the previous wrongdoing beyond the initial standardized statement. Even though playing Chinese patriotic song looks clumsy and out-of-context for an iconic French brand, and was taken largely as a joke by netizens and influencers who were at the show, Dior\u2019s desire to survive in China and its fear of losing the lucrative Chinese market was well-received among Chinese consumers.\u00a0Such an exaggerated choice of action, however, was much better received than undercompensating, as overreacting demonstrated Dior\u2019s resolution and fear, which soothed the outrage of some Chinese consumers.

Therefore, it produces and promotes fashions that the China market demands, such as the country\u2019s fascination with logos.", "Why logos now?", "China\u2019s current logomania has some cultural undertones worth analyzing. After China\u2019s Communist Revolution in 1949, there was an aggressive period of proletarian consciousness-building, and the government strongly discouraged consumerism of any kind. As a result, luxury consumption was considered an embarrassing bourgeois activity that the government penalized. During this time, luxury products disappeared from the market entirely, and the public was forced to embrace a mantra of modesty.", "During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Mao Zedong\u2019s Red Guards destroyed The Four Olds (Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and Old Ideas) and everything that symbolized a cultural or intellectual pursuit \u2014 paintings, books, antiquity, decorative pieces, and ceramics \u2014 were eradicated as examples of pretentious capitalist society. But in the eighties, China\u2019s economic revolution and the age of \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d began. This was defined by a 1986 episode of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which included the first major interview Deng Xiaoping would grant to a Western media outlet. In it, he said that \u201cto get rich is no sin. However, what we mean by getting rich is different from what you mean. Wealth in a socialist society belongs to the people.\u201d", "The return to conspicuous consumption meant that, once again, shopping could be promoted as a leisure activity, and China\u2019s appetite for luxury goods was no longer obstructed or condemned. In the following years, Western heritage brands such as Christian Dior, Herm\u00e8s, and Louis Vuitton were purchased in China as \u201cbadges of success\u201d and symbols of affluence. In China, the fastest way to communicate wealth and status is through a branded or logoed item, which is why Chinese consumers became smitten with logos. But there\u2019s an additional dimension to China\u2019s logomania that can be understood via the rise of the streetwear culture there.", "\u201cToday, logos are clearly back in fashion and at the forefront of a hyper-branded, irony-laden streetwear-driven aesthetic, which is itself a distinct throwback to the heavily-branded \u201990s and \u201900s,\u201d says Business of Fashion\u2019s Osman Ahmed. Indeed, logomania in China can primarily be linked to the triumph of hip-hop culture and its related streetwear aesthetic. Younger Chinese consumers believe that brands like Supreme and Off-White make logos cool because they remove the elitist connotations, as Gen-Z consumers aren\u2019t focused on communicating wealth through branded merchandise and logos. They prefer to seek out garments that convey a fresh and easygoing identity \u2014one that has inclusive overtones and responds to China\u2019s need to become \u201ca society where individuals respect social norms and aspire to achieve conformity while being assimilated into strong, cohesive social groups.\u201d", "Furthermore, China\u2019s logomania is connected to the rise of the middle class and the aspirational class. These groups do\u00a0believe that ostentatious luxury purchases are the best way to show society that they\u2019ve achieved personal success. Since truly luxurious products for the global aristocracy fall outside their price brackets, these consumers seek out legitimate alternatives, such as smaller luxury items like Chanel umbrellas with the CC logo. Not everyone can purchase haute couture Chanel garments or Martin Margiela vintage designs from a collection curated by Sotheby\u2019s Paris, but most middle-class consumers can afford accessories that have luxury logos plastered all over them.", "The final reason for China\u2019s new logomania (and a big one) is that Chinese millennials are nostalgic for their childhood and early teen years, and trends that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s have a significant influence on them. \u201cLogomania became popular again because what\u2019s old is, at some point, always new again,\u201d says Elle Style Director Nikki Ogunnaike to The Daily Beast. Also according to Ogunnaike, \u201cChildren of the \u201880s and \u201890s have a soft spot in their hearts for the trend they loved as a kid and are wearing it again as adults.\u201d And while Millennials have been the driving force behind logomania, this trend was also taken on by Generation Z, who gave logos \u201cstreet cred\u201d and an aura of coolness.", "In the upcoming years, Chinese consumers will continue to flaunt luxury logos \u2014 regardless of who\u2019s behind the trend or what market considerations fuel it. Consequently, luxury houses will continue to expand their logoed product lines, while Western consumers will also start looking into this new logoed lifestyle."]}, {"title": "The Rise of China\u2019s Girl Boss \u2014 Luxury\u2019s Newest Target", "meta": "September 23, 2019", "paragraphs": ["Despite a deep-seated patriarchal culture, China is one of the world\u2019s top countries regarding executive gender equality.

But, beginning in the late 1990s, the practice of licensing went downhill because of quality and design problems and the omnipresence of certain products, which brought about brand dilution. Consequently, after years of negative press, many professionals forgot about the positive benefits of licensing and how it can create win-win situations. Today, however, though a large number of luxury and premium brands have licensing agreements for their accessories and cosmetics lines, it seems like the newer practice of collaborating may be taking root.", "Licensing versus collaboration", "Younger consumers won\u2019t remember that there was a time when fashion collaborations seemed impractical and utopian. In 2002, when the Takashi Murakami x Louis Vuitton collection dropped, collaboration hype was just starting to take off. Today, collaborations are the rule of law, with Target partnering every year with a new fashion designer, Louis Vuitton teaming up with rap sensation Kanye West (2009), and Versace and Lanvin working with the Swedish fast-fashion retailer H&M (2011).", "The growing popularity of collaborations is explained by the dematerialization of luxury, which, according to Amati & Associates, \u201centails that our perception of luxury \u2014 and our definition of luxury \u2014 are changing and evolving toward a less material domain, with new forms of luxury emerging.\u201d This concept explains why the uber-wealthy segment is less interested in conspicuous consumption and luxury shopping sprees, and as a result, heritage houses have been forced to expand toward new consumer segments. Therefore, this trend has accelerated a return to licensing on one hand while also enhancing event-oriented collaborations.", "According to Steven Ekstract, Brand Director at Informa Markets, collaborations are a type of licensing. \u201cFor the luxury marketplace, these collaborations are usually limited run drops and specifically designed to create a buzz around the brands participating,\u201d Ekstract says. \u201cThe limited run makes them difficult to get and therefore in higher demand.\u201d", "Why licensing is a vital process for the future of luxury", "As Fashionbi notes, \u201ceyewear and cosmetics are the most licensed product groups in the fashion and luxury industry,\u201d and eyewear companies like Luxottica and Safilo have become major players in the eyewear licensing business because of their partnerships with luxury brands such as Dior, Chanel, Ralph Lauren, and Tiffany& Co.", "Most consumers see cosmetics and eyewear as a gateway to the world of luxury because these goods come at a lower price point.

Instead, they need to tell their customers what unique value they create specifically for them by the things they do exceptionally well.", "In luxury, it\u2019s about them (customer-centricity), not us (internal capabilities). Exceptional craftsmanship only creates value if there is a perceivable distinction between other luxury brands, and if this distinction can be expressed as a value proposition towards the customer. When we help clients to create new brands or sharpen and turnaround existing brands, we always define the brand\u2019s value proposition from the customer perspective.

Both are important and need to be a consistent part of the brand story. Few brands, however, have clarity around their emotional core, their purpose, and the way how they inspire their customers. What I often see is that they express, as their emotional positioning, the creation of dreams. The problem with this is: Unless the dream is explicitly defined, it seldom will create any customer value, and it won\u2019t differentiate the brand. More precision is needed.", "As a result, we typically find brands that are talking to themselves about themselves and in an imprecise way, and not differentiating enough from their competitors. Not surprisingly, a Chinese executive of a leading European fashion brand told me recently that, \u201cWe all do the same thing. All brands seem to do exactly what everyone else is doing.\u201d Clearly, this is not the path to create a sustainable competitive advantage and it explains why so many luxury brands struggle.

This is the fundamental lesson that global brands are slowly (and sometimes painfully) learning as they attempt to build popularity in China today. Global brands often conflate the two concepts, and the missing link is a deep cultural understanding of consumer purchase motivations.", "Well-established global brands often underestimate the importance of this. Decisions are driven by a lingering temptation to rest on the laurels of legacy, yet the path to success in China necessitates humble acceptance that the company is entering the market on the back foot.", "The world of social media is governed by new powers; Xiao Hong Shu, WeChat, and Douyin, among others, replace the global superpowers of Facebook and Google. Protection laws may not have the clout brands are accustomed to, as Chanel recently found out upon losing a court case to a jewelry seller claiming his products emblazoned with the signature \u2018double c\u2019 were not an attempt to copy the iconic brand.", "Language barriers and legal hurdles aside, one of the most significant and yet consistently underestimated reasons why global brands struggle in China is simply the cultural difference. Specifically, many fail to acknowledge that consumers in the Chinese market often have entirely different mindsets and motivations to those in the West.", "Brands have learned there are China-specific standards that must be upheld. In fashion, for example, simple criteria include meeting Asian sizing requirements (a Western small is typically a medium in China) and manufacturing clothes with shorter sleeve lengths to accommodate body shape, as well as introducing China-specific lines that speak to local fashion trends. Where many brands have flouted these golden rules and failed, Zara has embraced them\u00a0and is steadily building its market presence, despite the looming threat of fast-growing, tech-savvy local brands such as Heilan and Septwolves. These brands have around ten times more stores than Zara and H&M and enjoy considerable investment from major Chinese companies such as Tencent. For Zara, a delicate balance is at play: on the one hand maintaining the essence of a global brand, but on the other, adapting to satisfy the high expectations of Chinese consumers.", "When it comes to getting the basics right, Western brands would do well to partner with local counterparts. When Starbucks first entered China, decisions were delegated to Maxim Caterers, Starbucks\u2019 Hong Kong-based joint venture, and the company also partnered with mainland local chains, such as Mei Da from Beijing. Just as the initial founder of Starbucks changed much of his Italian-inspired concept to cater to the American market, so the brand humbly altered much of what makes the chain resonate with Americans for the Chinese market. Single chairs were exchanged for long, communal benches to allow large professional groups to flaunt their new generation co-working approach in public. The menu was overhauled to introduce more extensive tea and snack options, stores made space for logo-emblazoned accessories, and an office delivery was set up. Thus, in a move that Tom Doctoroff, author of What Chinese Want, claims is \u201cone of the great Houdini acts of marketing,\u201d Starbucks has successfully opened 3,300 stores in a market still not particularly keen on ground coffee.", "Starbucks\u2019 success illustrates that a unique, differentiated proposition is futile unless it is localized to consumer tastes and satisfies their basic requirements. The more established the brand, the more room they have to play, but until consumer trust is established, brands can never be too attentive to local customs.", "Unlike service brands such as Starbucks, who can moderate their offering to accommodate local tastes whilst keeping their core product, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands are often faced with the challenge of introducing an entirely unfamiliar product into the market with no room for modification. Such was the case with Pampers when it launched in 1997 in China as an entirely new concept. P&G\u2019s attempts to sell on price alone failed; despite being cheap, diapers were seen as white elephants, because mothers had no reason to believe diapers were superior to kaidangku (split pants), which allow infants to freely relieve themselves while put into a squat position by their parents. In fact, this method often potty-trains Chinese children quicker than their diaper-clad counterparts in the West due to the memory structures created by the repeated squat ritual.", "\u201cFor all Global brands adapting for China, understanding such deep-seated purchase motivations can be the difference between success and failure.\u201d", "When the local norm is to let your children run free, wrapping them in plastic is not seen as an act of parental kindness. But all this changed a decade later, when P&G re-launched with the campaign \u201cGolden Sleep,\u201d which claimed babies in diapers sleep better, helping them develop faster and achieve more at school. Behavior change was an essential step on the road to success, but the key to implementing that change came from something else. In the early 2000s, a mother\u2019s desire for her child to sleep well was rooted in her most fundamental desire at that time: for the child to perform better and ultimately to succeed. Today, the diaper industry in China is worth $8.24 million and is enjoying a projected growth of 7.1 percent per year. It pays to understand your target\u2019s motivations.", "For all Western brands adapting for China, understanding such deep-seated purchase motivations can be the difference between success and failure. When Marks & Spencer entered the Chinese market, the company assumed its TV dinner propositions (synonymous in the UK with quick, convenient \u2018home-style\u2019 comfort food for one) would appeal to the Chinese as an exotic alternative to their own comfort food. However, the ready meal space is crowded in China, from convenience stores offering facilities for the preparation of noodle and microwave dishes on-site, to increasing numbers of Hema stores in which a chef will cook anything you buy for you on the spot. Additionally, it goes without saying that British comfort food is not Chinese comfort food, nor is it necessarily the kind of British food that Chinese people like to try and find \u2018exotic.\u2019 As The Financial Times reported upon closure of the majority of the brand\u2019s outlets, \u201cthey had existing chains in Hong Kong and Malaysia, and they assumed the model would work for China,\u201d said Matthew Crabbe of consultancy Mintel, adding that \u201cthey didn\u2019t really adapt to the needs of Chinese consumers.\u201d Marks & Spencer had failed to reconcile the brand\u2019s distinct role in China with a new set of consumer needs and motivations.", "Brands capitalizing on industry trends in Western markets often see the same opportunities in China. However, to assume the trends are gaining traction with Chinese consumers for the same reasons as their American or European counterparts would be short-sighted. In beauty, for example, male makeup is gathering momentum around the world and global brands are increasingly looking for a slice of the male cosmetics industry. In Western markets, this growing demand is often attributed to increasing gender fluidity\u2014the demise of the \u201cmacho man\u201d stereotype having opened opportunities for creative experimentation. Not so in China, where articulations of the macho man stereotype, though again vastly different compared to the West, can still live in harmony with the concept of male makeup.", "For the Chinese, male makeup is just another method of self-improvement, and any man who goes to the gym or studies hard to get a better job is just as likely to embrace BB creams, eyebrow pencils, and even eyeshadow as additional weapons in his arsenal. From packaging design cues to marketing and influencer strategies, this necessitates a very different approach than a Western male makeup brand. As Jiaqi Luo of Jing Daily writes: \u201cTop-notch [Western] male beauty influencers such as James Charles and Gary Thompson (known as the \u201cthe plastic boy\u201d) are mostly gay men, and most of their advocacy promotes inclusivity or \u2018freedom of expression.\u2019\u201d A brand like M.A.C., for example, emphasizes its openness to all genders in China as it does in the United States, but its male models are typically K-Pop stars such as Zhang Yixing sporting black jeans and bling jackets with makeup used to accentuate his natural features.

Luxury is like love, and once consumers fall, prices no longer matter to some extent.", "Today, most luxury brands price benchmark their products with the products of their competitors, or else they use production costs as their pricing measure. This is the wrong idea, and I\u2019ll explain why. Many people think \u201cluxury\u201d is the equivalent of \u201can expensive price point,\u201d and many brands price that way. They use the price as a marker of luxury, which may work in the short-term but won\u2019t in the long term. That\u2019s because a high price point is a result of luxury; it isn\u2019t the driver. This is an important distinction. To sell luxury means to create extreme value. Once that value is created, a brand can price for it, but if the brand prices high without creating underlying value, it will not succeed over time.", "Normal to premium brands have two value drivers: functions and basic emotions. Both create the value that people pay prices for. If you think about Starbucks, a cup of coffee may cost between $3 and $5. You pay a bit more for the larger size and less for the smaller size. Hence, the price is \u2014 to some degree \u2014 the result of a logical, linear pricing structure. The more you get, the more you pay. On top of that, a more premium brand will charge a few percentage points more than a less premium brand. Everything makes logical sense. There are no surprises. This is the world of normal to premium brands.", "Luxury is different. Suddenly we are in a world where prices are detached from features or emotions. Think about a Lamborghini: It has a small cabin, isn\u2019t overly comfortable, only seats two, doesn\u2019t have a trunk, and is very loud inside. While it may be fast, a 7-seating Tesla Model X will outperform it in a sprint. In terms of functional features, the car should be priced at the lower end, However, at price points of $300,000 and up, the brand has a non-linear value jump, especially compared to the value-heavy Mercedes S Class or a BMW 5 Series. This is why: When we measure the value of a luxury brand, we find an added value component that normal or premium products don\u2019t have that I call Added Luxury Value (ALV).", "Added Luxury Value is comprised of some more obvious dimensions: social dominance, being an ultimate treat, adding self-esteem, and more, but it also has hidden dimensions like adding attractiveness, giving the aura of expertise, and signaling high-quality decision-making. Extensive research studies show that these are the real drivers of luxuriousness, and that produced ALV is also typically a multiplier of other value components. In other words: Added Luxury Value, is worth dramatically more than the functional or basic emotional value of a brand when it comes to luxury product, and this value is, ironically, created by the brand (branding) and not by the product itself.", "This is a remarkable insight. If you take a Lamborghini, the value of the car \u2014 excluding ALV \u2014 would be maybe around $50-100,000. But with ALV, it sells for $300,000 or above. Take a handbag: Without ALV, people may pay $50-100. Adding ALV makes a brand like Louis Vuitton sell for $2,000 and above, while Herm\u00e8s achieves price points of $10,000 or higher. Most of that value is due to ALV.", "If ALV is detached from the product (for instance, the design or the features), but connected to the brand and its story, then comparing one product to the other across brands makes no sense. However, most managers do exactly that. When they create prices, they look at what the competition is doing with the product and ignore the ALV they create. But it\u2019s important to estimate the ALV for both for the category and the brand, so a company can make pricing decisions in a data-driven way instead of simply \u201cdoing what everyone else is doing.\u201d", "Why is this important? What if, in the case of the Lamborghini, every company in a category is using gut feeling (in other words, benchmarking prices without factoring in ALV)? In this instance, there\u2019s a high likelihood that the pricing will be wrong. This is called a \u2018category bias,\u2019 and many brands fall in its trap.", "As an example, despite what experts and the media thought, all of the most expensive cars were too cheap ten years ago. In fact, I was considered crazy to suggest that a million-dollar car was too cheap. But today, Bugatti just sold their first new car for over $10 million, and new cars with price points between $2 and $5 million have become more \u201cnormal.\u201d They may still even be too cheap! Back then, the problem was that every competitor was too low at its highest price tier. Because every company observed each other and priced their products in line with the others, all the top luxury brands were too cheap. The difference in results after a price hike is dramatic. If a car company that sells 10,000 units per year could have sold their cars for an average of 100,000 U.S. dollars more than they did, the profit impact is $1 billion per year. That\u2019s a lot of money left on the table.", "It is remarkable how in many categories, limited editions sell out in no time: in fashion, jewelry, watches, handbags, and cars. Herm\u00e8s just sold out a limited-edition \u201cChina\u201d Birkin bag for more than $200,000 \u2014 practically the moment the bag was presented. If consumers pay this price without any hesitation, it\u2019s a sign that the price was far too low, and that a profit opportunity wasn\u2019t realized.", "Millennials and Gen Zers are the most active and avid luxury consumers ever. Together, they are also the most important consumer group today, accounting for over 40 percent of luxury sales worldwide and more than 80 percent in China.

Pricing a luxury brand by gut feeling is a cardinal mistake.

One path toward extreme value creation is telling the brand story more coherently and straightforwardly. A brand audit will help validate competitive brand positioning and storytelling and is advisable at least every two years. This brand story needs to be reflected along each customer journey touchpoint, and digital tools that generate real-time insights from around the world are needed to monitor and adjust that content.

It was just in 2016 that Bomoda and R3 Worldwide rated Gucci as the country\u2019s top brand in Study of Social Media Influencers.

Below, Jing Daily breaks down the five major reasons behind Louis Vuitton\u2019s runaway success and where they can improve in the future:", "1. A strong focus on younger consumers", "In the past few years, Louis Vuitton began reaching out to millennials and Gen Zers, which turned out to be a brilliant money-making idea. In the not-too-distant past, heritage brands only wanted to be associated with excess wealth and privilege. But today\u2019s luxury is more inclusive and less hostile. By collaborating with streetwear brands (Supreme), partnering with young influencers (Selena Gomez, Karlie Kloss, and Emma Chamberlain), and building an online presence that connects with younger consumers, Louis Vuitton has created a global uproar while rewriting the rules of audience engagement in this booming marketplace.", "Their digital performance is especially striking. With 7.38 million Twitter followers and 33 million Instagram followers, Louis Vuitton is leading the social media revolution globally and is proving that a heritage brand can be savvy with social media. While some heritage brands (Chanel) have remained highly inaccessible, Louis Vuitton continues to break new ground with social media engagement \u2014 an attitude that\u2019s atypical for luxury brands, who are often slow to engage with consumers online. Specific to China, Louis Vuitton attracted younger customers by highlighting streetwear collaborations and leveraging the power of KOLs in that country. Choosing rapper and television celebrity Kris Wu as their brand ambassador was an audacious move that sent both fans and haters into a frenzy while allowing social media conversations about the brand to thrive.", "2. Embracing digital innovation", "For all the talk about embracing digital innovation, most luxury brands have taken a slower approach to that change, and several luxury houses still haven\u2019t integrated consistent digital brand experiences. Yet, according to Digimind, a global social media intelligence company, 93 percent of consumer engagement with luxury brands takes place on Instagram, and 40 percent of luxury purchases are influenced \u2014 to a certain degree \u2014 by online content. So why haven\u2019t brands moved faster to digital? It seems as if many still don\u2019t know how to create a personalized digital experience or maintain a digital storefront that can generate traffic or sales. In contrast, Louis Vuitton is a digital pioneer, having just recently created a WeChat Mini Program specifically for the launch of their Virgil Abloh-designed sneakers.", "3. Stricter control of distribution channels", "Louis Vuitton has remained cautious with their distribution rights, and this vigilance has benefited the brand in the long run. Eventually, if a luxury house expands excessively (as Gucci has, for instance), it hurts the brand\u2019s overall status and value. Ralph Lauren is the perfect example of this. Due to international licensing agreements and aggressive sales policies, the brand lost much of its original identity and \u2018snooty\u201d appeal in China. Despite the fact that brands can now reach more potential consumers than ever, the allure of luxury is all about its exclusivity, and no one wants to invest in a widely available premium item. Louis Vuitton fans know that the brand doesn\u2019t have sales or a wholesale policy for department stores. Because of this, Louis Vuitton keeps their production and pricing in check, therefore, always maintaining their high-end appeal.", "4. Streamlining China operations", "According to the South China Morning Post, Louis Vuitton streamlined China operations \u201cto create a better consumer experience and improve margins.\u201d Michael Burke, Chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, says that Louis Vuitton closed eight stores in China but refurbished their existing ones. Moreover, all stores were supplied with full merchandise lines, including the highly coveted pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter collections.", "5. Staying in front of product trends", "According to a statement from Louis Vuitton, their Fashion and Leather Goods department \u201cdelivered an exceptional performance\u201d in 2018. A lot of that is because, through artistic collaborations (like the one with contemporary artist Jeff Koons in 2017, for instance), Louis Vuitton has resurrected iconic leather accessories, with younger consumers now enthusiastically embracing those products.", "Additionally, Louis Vuitton decided to take the customization trend a step further by starting their \u201cNow Yours Run Away\u201d personalization program for sneakers in October 2018. Since authenticity and self-expression are important to China\u2019s younger consumers, they like influencing the design process of the products they buy. This is why the customization trend responds well to their needs. In this case, Louis Vuitton found a balanced blueprint for success by adapting a long-selling product with strict considerations for quality and design to resonate with younger consumers.", "What then is next for Louis Vuitton in China? They supposedly will continue to invest in cross-channel customer experiences. But if the French luxury house is serious about keeping its pole position, it must stay relevant. WeChat and Douyin have become great marketing platforms in China, but Louis Vuitton needs to find new, innovative ways to reach their consumer base. Furthermore, one issue that remains is finding a balance between the brand\u2019s heritage and these types of innovation.", "Louis Vuitton is a digitally-minded forerunner in the field, but mature consumers might distance themselves from the brand because of overexposure. While the French luxury house is doing a great job at building awareness and talking to Gen Zers and millennials, they seem to be overlooking the potential of the mature consumers who have been their staunch supporters in the past. This is a heritage brand that moved from ads starring 20th-century titans like Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Francis Ford Coppola to instead featuring video game characters and teenagers in their campaigns. The future of Louis Vuitton depends on keeping younger generations of consumers around without neglecting their loyal, mature luxury buyers. Speaking to different niche groups one-on-one is the solution.", "In short, Louis Vuitton needs to discover new growth opportunities without damaging the reputation of the brand. Managing brand exposure in the new global economy is a real balancing act, but no brand is better positioned to walk this tightrope than the luxury market\u2019s reigning champ."]}, {"title": "How Should Luxury Brands Represent Masculinity in China?", "meta": "July 26, 2019", "paragraphs": ["The recent choice of sensitive heartthrob Keanu Reeves as the new face of Saint Laurent illustrates the evolution of masculinity at a global level, and so-called \u2018alpha men\u2019 are selling less inside China.", "The most visible proof of changing male preferences in marketing from alpha to beta can be seen in the growing popularity of \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d in China.

Similar to \u201cpuppy dogs,\u201d these \u201cwolf dogs\u201d are still primarily characterized by their pretty faces and flawless skin.", "When brands target men \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d a similar distinction between good and bad boys applies, yet the emphasis is instead placed on energy and will for personal achievement rather than simply looks.", "As this \u201candrogenization\u201d of men continues, women, conversely, are being marketed more as alphas, with strong and almost \u201cmasculine\u201d personalities. Thanks to the booming \u201cSheconomy,\u201d brands are targeting more financially independent women through advertisements that feature images of liberated women in control of their destiny. They\u2019re often seen driving their car or motorcycle alone and enjoying themselves without a man in the picture. It\u2019s an image that particularly resonates in China right now.", "Body positivity and the diversification of beauty standards are also progressing in the country, albeit slowly. The popularity of China\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9, Wang Ju, a fierce feminist role model who\u2019s short and \u201cheavy\u201d with dark skin, symbolizes this evolution. So does last year\u2019s \u201cBare skin project\u201d campaign by Japanese cosmetics brand SK-II, which shows the brand\u2019s ambassadors without makeup and encouraging women to love their natural looks.", "Compared to femininity, representations of masculinity are lagging far behind. With \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d men, the focus remains on beauty standards of perfection rather than personality \u2014 youth instead of achievement.", "For several years \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d have been flooding the advertisements of local mass-market brands selling everything from food and beverages to high-end brands in beauty, fashion, watches, or even cars. Luxury brands have been widely using \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d to rejuvenate their brand images as well as attract their legions of fans. But appeasing this audience as well as the brand\u2019s all while expressing an authentic voice can be tricky.", "While mass-market brands often use anonymous \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d models, luxury brands are exclusively endorsed by the most famous idols, singers, or actors in China. But there\u2019s a problem: Most of the famous idols are overexposed in the media and already have endorsements from a myriad of brands. The actor Yang Yang, for instance, is the face of Guerlain, Montblanc, Saint Laurent eyewear, Puma, Alfa Romeo, Pepsi, and Colgate.", "Another common difficulty has to do with the street-style images of many \u201cLittle Fresh Meat\u201d singers, which can run counter to the renowned elegance of classic heritage brands. For instance, the \u2018I need U\u2019 campaign from the 200-year-old French jewelry brand Chaumet \u2014 named for a song by the popular singer Zhang Yixing \u2014 was widely criticized online. The artist\u2019s hip-hop performance was seen as irrelevant to the romantic narration of a senior couple remembering a loving moment years earlier in Paris.", "But it can be a risk for luxury brands is crossing the line in terms of gender representation. Men wearing makeup in China may not be judged as homosexual (unlike in the West) but rather as striving for self-improvement. However, the Chinese beauty brand Perfect Diary, which featured singer Zhu Zhengting to promote their lipstick, was heavily criticized online for the singer\u2019s look in their campaign. His facial features in heavy makeup (high cheekbones, high nose) and seductive poses were found to be too feminine and disturbing to fans, even though it is common in China for men to advertise for makeup brands, particularly lipstick.", "Last year, the Xinhua News Agency criticized \u201ceffeminate\u201d male celebrities and a \u201csick culture\u201d that had a \u201cnegative impact on teenagers.\u201d Since then, brands have paid extra attention to their campaigns to avoid featuring men as \u201csissies.\u201d", "The redefined representation of masculinity in China is currently midstream.

Accordingly, the tai tai with her high-consumption lifestyle can be considered the quintessential luxury consumer.", "Interestingly enough, despite being brand-conscious and having significant purchasing power and luxury know-how, the tai tai consumer group is still largely neglected in luxury marketing campaigns in China.

This stable behavior stands in sharp contrast to the luxury consumption patterns of younger, less experienced female buyers (Gen-Z and Millennial women) who respond to emotional stimulants and impulses.", "In fact, because of her immense fortune, we often see the tai tai as an extravagant, self-indulgent consumer \u2014 but don\u2019t expect her to flaunt her wealth. She will value luxury brands that communicate a subtle, understated elegance (Chlo\u00e9, Chanel), and she\u2019ll expect a certain level of discretion in transactions.

But this seems to contradict the continued high growth rates of the most successful luxury brands in China like Dior, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, or Gucci. How can we talk about them failing to address China\u2019s biggest market?", "Yes, many brands are doing well, but most successful brands aren\u2019t tapping into their full potential, and many others are failing miserably. While the majority of brands entering China have a steep learning curve, nearly every brand is not maximizing their potential in the market today. Here are five reasons why brands are leaving good money on the table when it comes to millennials:", "1. Underestimating Chinese consumers", "Chinese millennial consumers are highly educated, and their familiarity with digital tools makes them highly empowered. Despite that, brands do little \u2014 or the wrong type of \u2014 market research. Traditional market research is a waste of money in China because surveys focus on too few cities, don\u2019t reach enough consumers, and their results are too slow. In the fast-changing world of Chinese millennial consumers, studies that were taken even two months ago might already be useless or misleading. Only real-time consumer measurements of AI-powered social media listening techniques can steer brands accurately in China. Chinese social media networks are firewalled and challenging to analyze, but with the right expertise and machine learning, brands can correctly observe or analyze data on their consumers, brand, competition, and more.", "2. Using the wrong communication content", "Many brands fail because they convince themselves that the content produced for the rest of the world will also be relevant in China. Aside from the content itself, brands must know the delivery systems. Many underestimate the importance of Chinese key opinion leaders (KOL) and influencers, given that they help brands successfully engage with potential customers on local social media platforms like WeChat. Meanwhile, companies waste millions of dollars with \u201cclassic\u201d advertising in China instead of fully embracing digital methods that produce a measurable ROI. Creating the wrong type of content not only wastes money on bad methods, but brands can\u2019t even measure whether or not that marketing has lead to any significant sales.", "3. Underestimating the power of brands in China", "Chinese consumers love brands because they identify with them. That\u2019s why brand storytelling is much more important in China than in any other place in the world. Yet despite this, most brands do not create an end-to-end brand experience for Chinese consumers. With few exceptions, they focus on selling and not on creating an experience across all touch points. That requires a thorough brand audit, a positioning exercise, and a customer journey assessment. Without perfect brand storytelling at each interaction point, luxury brands will lose the Chinese consumer, without exception. It\u2019s surprising that luxury brands aren\u2019t rigorous about experience creation. Chinese millennials are more discerning in China than in other countries, yet they are not serviced better.", "4. Not being digital enough", "Some brands have a CRM (customer relationship management) system, but it\u2019s handled by customer service, while others have a CRM online, but one that isn\u2019t at all related to store visits. In other words, many brands do not use their most valuable asset: data about their consumers. And by not using their data, they are not servicing their consumers sufficiently. Therefore, by not being digital enough, they create inferior consumer experiences. This is positively the kiss of death in China. Everything MUST be digital there. In all cases, a digital infrastructure must be designed and deployed that connects all data \u2014 including sales data \u2014 and uses advanced data querying methods to create highly personalized experiences that feel luxurious. Only digital means can do that today.", "5. There is no free lunch", "Launching in China without a budget and just hoping you\u2019ll attract hundreds of millions of millennials in China is a guarantee for failure. Weak brands in China with bad economics, unprofitable store locations, and expensive overhead costs will infinitely weaken a brand, and in such scenarios, the brand\u2019s best talent will quit, further accelerating its downfall. Investing in the perfect launch, after thorough brand and strategy development, is absolutely necessary. For many luxury companies, China has become their biggest headache and correcting mistakes winds up being much more expensive than if they\u2019d done it right from the beginning.", "In short, brands need to rethink their approach when it comes to understanding China and its millennial consumers. They need to become consumer-centric, meaning that they must create relevant content and build a strong brand identity. That requires a strong story and a rigorous customer journey design. They also need to become digital: If they think they are already digital, then they need to become even more digital. And they definitely can\u2019t launch in China without investing first.

In short, the daigou market is far from dead, contrary to what Chinese and Western media had predicted.", "And although they\u2019re surviving, daigous have been transforming the way they do business. Daigous in Europe, for instance, many of whom are studying there at prestigious universities, are making the shift away from solely acting as buyers to functioning as personal shoppers who offer style advice to wealthy Chinese customers back home. To keep things discreet, many daigous have created invitation-only group chats on WeChat where they can live-stream their store visits, market their product offers, and post celebrity-endorsed content to help build demand among their customers. Jing Daily was invited into two daigou-buyer group chats \u2014 one based in Milan and the other in Paris \u2014 to get an insider look at the current demand for luxury styles.

Demand for these three top brands has never fluctuated, while other brands keep alternating.\u201d Her customers agreed. One from Shenyang, a northeastern Chinese city, said, \u201cI personally prefer more trendy brands like Givenchy or Balenciaga, but I need to have the luxury staples first.\u201d By saying \u201cluxury staples,\u201d she meant items that act as status symbols like Louis Vuitton\u2019s iconic totes, anything Herm\u00e9s, and the Chanel 2.55 bag. These models are known as \u00a0\u201c\u5165\u95e8\u6b3e\u201d (\u201cluxury entries\u201d) in millennial China, and the Shenyang customer noted, \u201cThese bags are a sort of social currency in the adult world.\u201d", "But changes are noticeable, albeit small ones. \u201cIn recent years, I have found more and more customers requesting fashion-forward pieces from Louis Vuitton such as Nano No\u00e9 and Boite Chapeau rather than the traditional icons like Neverfull or Speedy,\u201d said the Milan daigou. So even though the demand for the luxury staple brands has remained steady over the years, today\u2019s younger customers often opt for novelty in those brands rather than stick to the classics the way their parents\u2019 generation would.", "Customer demand shifted from the traditional icon NeverFull to the more fashion-forward Boite Chapeau, or its Chinese nickname \u201c\u8f6f\u5706\u997c\u201d, meaning soft round cookie.

This iconic luxury brand, best known in China for its Submariner models, saw a huge surge in demand for its green model rather than its classic black one. \u201cFive years ago, most customers only bought the black watch, but now people see it as a pass\u00e9, or at least only for conservative middle-age businessmen,\u201d said the Milan daigou. \u201cToday my customers mostly ask me to get them the green one, because it\u2019s more bold-looking and harder to get.\u201d", "More Chinese consumers today prefer Rolex\u2019s green submariner rather than the classic black model.

Because of that photograph of Chinese singer Faye Wong, demand for the French heritage leather brand Goyard has soared. With an incredibly strong celebrity culture, Chinese consumers tend to associate certain products with specific celebrities, like Faye Wong with Goyard and Fan Bingbing with LV\u2019s Alma collection. \u201cThe word \u2018\u660e\u661f\u540c\u6b3e\u2019 (celebrity same style) is powerful at all times,\u201d said the Milan daigou.", "China\u2019s long-term style icon Faye Wong has put the French heritage brand Goyard on the \u201cIt\u201d list.

The country\u2019s rising upper-middle-class households, according to the report, is the backbone of the growth, stating that 350 million people in China will earn between $2,600 and $3,900 per month per household by 2025.", "", "With a slew of luxury brands from LVMH to Kering to Herm\u00e8s delivering their latest earnings results in recent weeks, there\u2019s a growing concern that luxury in China has become a winner-takes-all market. \u201cYou see strong brands getting stronger, and not-so-strong brands getting weaker,\u201d said Daniel Zipser, Senior Partner of McKinsey, as well as one of the major authors of the report. \u201c[But] I do think there is an opportunity for brands that are not as big and as strong in the China market to turn around and to accelerate their growth. The reason is that Chinese luxury consumers today are very diverse.\u201d", "Zipser highlighted the younger generations \u2014 Millennials and Gen-Z \u2014 the segment that he considered looking for diversity in their choice of brands and having a strong desire for experimentation. \u201cTo young generations, brands are important but not as important as to the older generations,\u201d he said. \u201cJust come with right strategies and engage this segment in digital means, there is an opportunity for brands that are not that strong today to actually change pace and track, and to become a success tomorrow.\u201d", "Below, Jing Daily summarized four major takeaways from the report:", "", "Chinese shoppers are both well-informed and new", "To a certain extent, the McKinsey report challenges the current \u201csophistication\u201d discourse about Chinese luxury shoppers, pointing out that a large segment of luxury consumers are new to this type of consumerism.\u00a0Its survey indicates 50 percent of Chinese post-90s generation and over 30 percent of the post-80s respondents only made their first luxury purchase last year. For the older generations like the post-65s and the post-70s group, it\u2019s true as well.

It is equally important for brands to understand how this finding is going to shape and affect their overarching strategies from product design, retail, to marketing and branding.", "Chinese consumers are trend-driven", "Chinese consumers\u2019 heavy reliance on digital media to receive information on luxury and fashion makes their shopping decisions trend-driven. \u201cThese new luxury consumers are influenced more by what is happening right now, leaving ample room for brands with the right strategy to shape their tastes,\u201d the report stated.", "", "This explains why \u201cIT\u201d bags, shoes, and clothes abound in the Chinese market. A great number of customers, who are not as sophisticated and discerning as the Western counterparts, are hugely influenced by what celebrities, fashion key opinion leaders (KOLs), and brands say and recommend via social media. An example used by McKinsey to illustrate this point is how Chanel promoted its Gabrielle bag in China. The brand first hired Yang Mi, one of China\u2019s top actresses (and who represented brands including Estee Lauder, Michael Kors, and Stuart Weitzman), to pose for the campaign, which stirred widespread public interest and then collaborated with KOLs like Mr. Bags to push the campaign message to its targeted audience.", "Luxury shopping activities bring social capital", "The underlying social nature of luxury shopping is particularly important to Chinese shoppers, the report said. Young Chinese consumers view ownership and affiliation with designer brands as a form of social capital; not just something to wear \u2014 but a lifestyle choice that marks them as part of a distinct and exclusive community. McKinsey also noted nearly 70 percent of post-90s consumers, who they surveyed, said purchasing luxury goods was a way to make them feel distinct from others.", "The overwhelmingly social nature of luxury consumption in China also made consumers become more aware and appreciative for craftsmanship, the report said. Younger consumers, in particular, tend to value design, fabric, and the production process.", "Sales associates = personal stylists to young Chinese shoppers", "McKinsey further notes Chinese shoppers\u2019 expectation on brands\u2019 sales associates edge higher and higher, as they look for personalization and customization from their interaction with luxury brands.

This younger generation expects a personalized service approach, from helping pick out accessories based on an intimate knowledge of the customer\u2019s personality or their previous purchases or preferences to being able to help them get into\u00a0fashion shows or parties \u2014 more as a friend than merely a salesperson.", "Additionally, the sales staff is an important pillar in building a seamless, omnichannel shopping experience for consumers, the report says.

AI is just a component of it and makes sense in specific cases where complex connections between data points need to be identified.

As an example: Imagine that you regularly shop at your local Louis Vuitton store, let\u2019s say in Shanghai. They know you, and the service experience is tailored to you. Then you travel to Hong Kong on a business trip. Ideally, the store staff should know all about your history and preferences, and you should feel at home. What you don\u2019t want is to feel like a stranger just because you are not at your home store or because you access the brand online. All touchpoint experiences need to be connected and seamless.

They\u2019re not taking it to the next step to apply what they have done and learned from certain campaigns to improve the overall omnichannel capabilities.

So not working with them is almost unrealistic.", "ST: Brands can control prices, but today in China, we are seeing a lot of them cooperating. So they have to open stores on Tmall or WeChat. They have less control because you are on another platform. So what is happening right now is that we are starting to see aggregators. You see the coming of Tmall Luxury Pavilion and [JD.com] TopLife, but over there you\u2019re still not in total control of your brand. Why? Because you\u2019re still creating a store within this, and you know from time to time Alibaba and JD.com can decide when they want to have discounts.", "GM: I think what is more important is that brands need to know their development stage in the market and how they can collaborate.

I was really impressed by how quickly and dramatically China had changed, so I decided to take my family to different cities, not just Beijing or Shanghai, but also Xi\u2019an, Chengdu, and Guangzhou. I met Mr. Li (CEO of Secoo) at the Fortune conference in Guangzhou, and he invited me to come to their annual dinner.", "Before I left, he asked me if I could stay and be a consultant for two months beginning in March.

That has said almost everything because the difference is that we are multi-category. We don\u2019t just sell fashion, but also bags, wine, cars, travel packages and more. Fashion is one of the most important categories but also a logical one. We have been doing fashion for a long time, but we want to grow all the categories deeper and better with more curated selections and brands.", "For instance, we now offer \u2018Best of China\u2019, which serves products made and designed by Chinese brands.

They also like the brands themselves and have an interest in local products, which aren\u2019t very trendy in Europe at the moment.", "To attract Chinese consumers, from my experience, you need to respect and understand them to fulfill their needs. I read a lot about China on a daily basis, and consumers immediately react to that. If you want to just use them, that\u2019s a different story. You could attract bad social media or have an amazing experience.

First, brands need to \u2018speak Chinese\u2019. I don\u2019t speak Chinese, but I can understand their attraction to fashion, quality and creativity. The second point is technology. They are incredibly savvy compared to other countries. Mobile payment is very common in China but not elsewhere.

The good surprise when I worked as a consultant was how I had the opportunity to learn and give my experiences to other people.

As they experiment with sweeter and more powerful fragrances, it opens the door to the gustatory, or taste and flavor family of scents, so far underrepresented in the Chinese market.

There is no one-size-fits-all style. Different cultures expect different things in different contexts. Sometimes, you have to be a bit directive when you need to bring a change and drive people there. In some other cases, it is more of a consensus-based management style where you pull people and energy together. The first thing as a manager that you should learn is that you have to adjust your style to the role at that time.

It can refer to European thinkers of the Renaissance, and Sun Tzu, the author of his Art of War. The representative thinker from the Renaissance is Machiavelli who was a pessimist who believed that only the paranoid survived. But Erasmus was more of a believer in knowledge, in education, and said that wise people will make wise things. In the Art of War, Sun Tzu said, \u2018any war reduces the energy of the world\u2019, so the best is not to go to war, but rather to turn your enemies into your allies, which I think is really true. Do not waste your energy on useless fights.

Cartier did something similar earlier this year.", "\u201cIn January, we had a high jewelry exhibition in Shanghai, said Vigneron. The last day, it was open to the public. High jewelry was perceived to be something exclusive, but 2,000 people lined up in the snow to see the beauty. It was an opportunity to share a real sense of beauty. That was culture too and the setting was beautiful.\u201d", "Exhibitions are also a powerful communication tool for the younger generation, said Vigneron.", "\u201cOne of the differences between the generation of today and the past is that, the generation in the past learned things by reading books and magazines, but the current generation wants to learn things right away. An exhibition is good way because they come to experience it right away, to look and feel.\u201d", "Summing up his thoughts on the intersection between art and luxury, Vigneron said, \u201cMany brands are trying to link themselves with culture in various ways, which are good.

This growth was driven by the super-premium and above price segments where Lin sees the strongest growth opportunity.", "Such a perception is shared by other leading alcohol sellers.", "\u201c[China] is a more premium market and sells higher-end products like XO and VSOP for cognac, whereas the U.S. primarily sells cognac that is at the VS level,\u201d said Hasumi Ozawa, the spokesperson of Suntory Holdings, another world-leading brewing and distilling company.", "Data accumulated by the Hurun report shows that the average purchase price of whiskey is now 520RMB ($83) per bottle in China. About 30 percent of buyers are willing to spend more than 1,000 RMB ($159) on a purchase.", "This 30 percent is mostly represented by younger consumers more interested in trying something new with the means to pay for it. About 87 percent of HNWIs under 30 have become more interested in whiskey in the past three years.

Zhao says it\u2019s like \u201ca man with noble character shouldn\u2019t be burdened with material things.\u201d", "Perceived uniqueness has made single malts a favorable choice for gifting and collection. About half of Chinese HNWIs buy whiskey for gifting occasions, while more than 32 percent buy for their own collections. Brands and vintage are the most often-considered factors, but the rarity of certain single malts can also increase appreciation, Zhao noted.", "To prosper in China, whiskey sellers have to educate consumers about the uniqueness of their product, rather than try to compete on price. If anything, higher prices speak to the prestige of the product and the material success of the consumer. Marketers focus less on a hard sell than on public education, appreciation, and connoisseurship.", "The Chinese whiskey market remains immature despite its rapid growth. For leading international liquor sellers like Suntory, \u201cit is more important for us to work together to educate the Chinese consumers on the different categories of international spirits like cognac, whiskey, gin, etc, and grow the entire international spirits segment as opposed to trying to competing against each other for market share,\u201d Ozawa told Jing Daily.", "On the other hand, international spirit sellers are facing great competition from traditional baijiu, an industry that has received policy support from the Chinese government, and still accounts\u00a0for two-thirds of the spirits market in China. Establishing a foothold through the younger, upper-middle class, and building boutique brands in China are the most viable strategies for foreign sellers, said Zhao.", "Devoted whiskey bars are another way that the drink is being sold and promoted in China. In 2017 alone, more than 300 new whiskey bars opened their doors in China. Beyond selling drinks, such bars typically provide opportunities for customers to learn about aroma, flavor, ingredients and blends, often through sit-down tastings.", "Diageo has opened its own whiskey boutiques in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Shenzhen to help speed along the process, Lin said, as well as setting up mentoring events including the Diageo Whiskey Academy education program to promote whiskey culture in China.", "The younger Chinese consumer is more active on digital and e-commerce platforms than their counterparts in other countries.

Sourcing From Cheaper Markets", "Secondly, as many top luxury brands originate from Europe, the European market usually has the cheapest items.

But as Hong Kong sits just next to Mainland China, many Chinese consumers might choose to shop there themselves.", "3. Hype and Limited Editions", "A third reason that daigou can still benefit from their businesses is that some goods are so popular that they become very hard to obtain. Therefore, whoever has the ability to get the goods can decide the resale price.

Reaching Lower Tier Cities", "It is worth noticing that many cities in China still do not have flagship stores for luxury brands. While luxury brands are beginning to improve their e-commerce offerings, many people living in these cities still have to use daigou if they don\u2019t have an opportunity to travel domestically. \u201cThe LV store in my city is small and many items cannot be found there,\u201d said Yuan Yi, a college student from central China\u2019s Wuhan City. Many daigou\u00a0also pointed out that consumers are lazy and some of them won\u2019t even spend time on price comparison or go out for shopping.

With JD.com\u2019s investment, we agreed to integrate Farfetch technology with JD.com and WeChat data so that we are able to do online marketing in China, building relationships with people who buy on JD.com and use WeChat. That has been implemented since October. We are now able to target our advertisements and online marketing with much better data, using JD.com\u2019s 280 million shoppers and almost one billion users on WeChat.", "To be specific, we have two areas where we\u2019re collaborating with JD.com.

Farfetch has 250,000 products online. That is ten times more than our competitors. We have 1,000 designers on the platform. If you can really offer unique things to China, millennials will be really interested in them because they want to be unique, to reaffirm their individuality, and this is something that Farfetch really empowers them to do.", "I think, then, it is also about the technological experience, making sure that we have a Chinese app. Chinese consumers\u2019 natural behaviors are buying either on WeChat or on an app. It is really important for them to have a fantastic mobile experience with the Chinese app. It is also crucial with WeChat.

The treatment provides people with free skin test and helps them design a customized skincare plan, which picks products that\u00a0best match\u00a0their skin type out of the diverse product offering by SK-II.", "Guiding online followers to brick-and-mortar stores has become increasingly important for luxury brands to convert their online following into sales. In SK-II\u2019s case, it also works in the opposite way as the brand also has\u00a0an online boutique on WeChat. For any customer who visits SK-II\u2019s physical store, the promotion specialists can easily guide them to place their order on WeChat after offering them a free skin test.", "The WeChat post that promotes this event has more than 100,000 views, outperforming most of the articles during the same period, with some of them even featuring Chinese high-profile celebrities.", "2. WeChat x Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Coach", "From March 24 to April 23, American luxury brand Coach is organizing an event that encourages its existing WeChat followers to invite new friends to join the brand on the app. According to the instructions shown on Coach\u2019s WeChat page (Image 1 above), each participant can generate his or her unique barcode through Coach and share it with their friends who have not followed the account yet. Participants will gain 20 points if they succeed in getting one person to follow the account. Moreover, as long as the participant\u2019s friends extract the barcode, the person can also earn 5 additional points for each new follower. The points that followers earn during the event are cumulative and can be used to redeem a cash coupon worth 300 RMB for a number of Coach\u2019s signature products, ranging from passport covers, to crossbody bags and handbags.", "It has become increasingly difficult\u00a0for luxury brands to grow their audience on WeChat, so Coach is playing it smart here by leveraging the influence of their current followers to attract new ones. The event is also meant to be fun in order\u00a0to engage with the followers and incentivize them to tap into their social network to support a\u00a0brand they love.", "3.

The post showed a number of pictures where Wu wore the latest version of the Octo Finissimo Automatic Watch. At the end of the post, readers can enter the WeChat store of the brand and pre-order the Octo series.", "4. WeChat x Gamification: Hugo Boss", "Hugo Boss designed an interactive gift-hunting game to introduce its new products.", "During this past Christmas season, German luxury brand Hugo Boss used an interactive gift-hunting game to appeal to Chinese consumers and introduce its latest products. According to the digital agency Curiosity China, the brand created a virtual reality shopping experience on WeChat and players need to find the four parts of a new character named \u201cBossbot\u201d in its virtual store to complete the game. Once completed, participants are\u00a0directed to a page with pricing information, styling tips, and e-commerce links to Hugo Boss\u2019s latest products.", "5. WeChat x Moments Ads: Chanel", "Chanel launched an ad campaign on WeChat\u2019s Moments feed after WeChat upgraded the service.", "WeChat has recently upgraded its Moment advertising by adding new features to the service. Many luxury brands, including Chanel, have been pioneers in placing advertising campaigns on WeChat\u2019s Moments stream by promoting its 2017 Spring/Summer Ready-to-Wear Collection. The campaign shows up on the timelines of a targeted group of users, and interested viewers need to click on the image to watch the full commercial. The Chanel case features a 15-second video, several images of its latest products, and links to its online store.", "6. WeChat x Philanthropy: Louis Vuitton", "Louis Vuitton promoted its #makeapromise campaign on WeChat in tandem with its global initiative.", "On January 14, two days after its global launch, the French luxury powerhouse brought its #makeapromise campaign in partnership with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to WeChat. Similar to its global initiative, the brand promises to donate US$200 for each Silver Lockit Jewelry item it sells to UNICEF, supporting kids in need.", "The WeChat post that promotes the campaign also features many Chinese celebrities who have shown their genuine support for the initiative and have called for the public\u2019s attention to it. Those\u00a0interested can click the link at the end of the post to visit the official site featuring\u00a0the special-edition products, but they need to order the item online and pick it up in one of Louis Vuitton\u2019s boutiques across the country.", "To learn more about how brands can use WeChat marketing to optimize their sales in China,\u00a0click here to download our latest WeChat report."]}, {"title": "Luxury Brands Are Beginning to Embrace WeChat\u2019s New Multimedia Moments Ads", "meta": "March 24, 2017", "paragraphs": ["Not long after offering brands an easier and more affordable way to create Moments advertising, WeChat recently gave its marketing tool a major facelift. The upgraded version, which was launched in January, offers an improved\u00a0marketing opportunity for luxury brands, as now they are able to utilize a number of different storytelling methods to attract and engage with WeChat users in a more creative way. Luxury brands, including Chanel, Miu Miu, and Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) among others, have become early participants in placing multimedia ads on Moments.", "Today, the Moments stream within WeChat is one of the top options for advertising platforms for luxury brands in China. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. After launching Moments ads in early 2015, Tencent took a cautious stance in completely opening up the space to advertisers. It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that Tencent lowered the costs of advertising on Moments to 50,000 RMB from 200,000 RMB, and added a self-service feature to make it more accessible for brands, according to a report by Walk the Chat.", "It\u2019s arguable that WeChat\u2019s move to improve the functionality of its Moments ads is a timely one for the luxury industry. Many studies, including recent research by digital intelligence firm L2, have shown that organic growth of WeChat followers had stagnated for luxury brands in 2016. The option to advertise on Moments, the place where more than 60 percent of app users spend most of their time, has thus become increasingly crucial for luxury brands to further attract new users and retain the interest of their existing followers.", "WeChat Moments\u2019\u00a0latest features allow brands to include short videos\u2014either in a six-second or 15-second format\u2014as a teaser to be shown on a user\u2019s timeline. Interested viewers can click on the video, through which they will be directed to an internal ad page to view the full commercial.", "Currently, brands can run ads in the following formats: text, photos, slideshows, full-screen videos, embedded videos, and 360-degree panoramas. There is no limit set on the number of formats that brands are allowed to use in one ad. In\u00a0the past, brands were only able to post text with up to six photos, or a video.", "The new Moments ads have also stopped linking to an HTML5 web page that\u2019s hosted on Tencent\u2019s server\u00a0in an attempt to improve user experience. An official statement on WeChat\u2019s website reads, \u201cthe new Moments ads accelerate the loading speed by nearly 10 times,\u201d which has the potential to greatly decrease user bounce rate.", "However, it is still unclear if Moments ads rates are the same with the new features.\u00a0Tencent was not available for an immediate comment.", "Italian luxury fashion brand Miu Miu placed a multimedia ad on WeChat Moments to promote its 2017 Spring/Summer Ready-to-Wear collection.", "The upgraded Moments advertising features provide luxury brands with a more appealing and engaging way to grow and interact with WeChat users. Italian high fashion brand Miu Miu is one of the early adopters of this ad format, using it to promote its 2017 spring/summer ready-to-wear collection. Targeted users on WeChat will see Miu Miu\u2019s six-second promotional video, which is marked as \u201csponsored\u201d on their timeline.

The following two pages contain a link to the product, intending to encourage viewers to buy it immediately.", "With new the features in action for less than two months, it is too early to assess the effectiveness and costs and benefits of it for luxury brands, but the new and improved Moments ads are poised to be the next important marketing opportunity\u00a0for companies\u00a0that\u00a0want to keep growing and engaging with a Chinese audience on WeChat\u00a0in 2017.", "To learn more about Moments advertising and how brands can use WeChat marketing to optimize their sales in China,\u00a0click here to download our latest WeChat report."]}, {"title": "WeChat\u2019s Transformative Role for Beauty Brands in China", "meta": "March 15, 2017", "paragraphs": ["Both beauty and luxury fashion brands in China have been utilizing WeChat\u2014Chinese consumers\u2019 all-in-one mobile app\u2014to promote brand awareness and interact with their audiences. A new finding on audience engagement with beauty brands on WeChat in 2016 challenges the traditional role of the app as a content-producing platform. The emerging trend seems to suggest that content is no longer as important as it used to be, leading beauty brands to use a number of alternative methods to drive engagement. From a one-sided, brand-directed conversation to a more interactive, one-on-one communication tool, the change of users\u2019 preference along with the evolving platform itself has shaped the app\u2019s new identity\u2014a central hub that encompasses customer relationship management (CRM), commerce, online-to-offline (O2O), content, and more.", "L2\u2019s \u201cBeauty China 2017\u201d report finds that the number of post-viewings by beauty brands on WeChat plummeted in 2016.", "In the latest \u201cBeauty China 2017\u201d report that studies the Digital IQ Index of 98 beauty brands in China, digital\u00a0intelligence firm L2 found there was a dramatic drop in viewership of WeChat posts by these brands. Statistics show 84 percent of all posts accumulated less than 25,000 views. In previous years, posts by well-known brands, including Shiseido and Lanc\u00f4me, could easily generate more than\u00a050,000 views. These brands accordingly decreased the frequency of their posts from 2.78 times per week in Q4 2015 to 1.73 in Q3 2016. In spite of the dramatic drop in post viewership, the overall level of engagement between brands and customers on the app was still able to increase slightly from the year before.", "A basic interpretation of the figures suggests that\u00a0followers of these beauty brands on WeChat seemed to lose interest in reading posts in 2016. Indexed brands thus recognized the lackluster response early on and pushed out a number of alternative ways to interact with their audience so that the overall level of engagement was not largely affected. According to\u00a0the report, brands that have performed well digitally have used diverse ways to prevent a sharp drop in audience engagement due to decreasing interest in blog posts last year. The methods range from sampling campaigns and live-streaming events, to daily check-ins, loyalty programs, and gamification.", "Ever since WeChat became one of the most powerful communication platforms in China, blog posting has been frequently used by brands to interact with their audience. This one-sided, content-dominated method of communication helps many brands grow their number of followers and raise brand awareness among Chinese consumers when they\u2019re starting out.", "However, late last year, digital\u00a0marketing agency Curiosity China noted that the value of WeChat had shifted away from \u201cpushing as many messages as we can to an underdetermined audience.\u201d", "Danielle Bailey, the main author of the report and\u00a0L2\u2019s APAC research director said they advise\u00a0brands \u201cnot to lead with content strategy on WeChat as this content is seen on average by just 16,658 users for beauty brands and 12,728 users for luxury brands in 2017.\u201d", "As the \u201csole genius\u201d brand in L2\u2019s Digital IQ Index, premium cosmetic producer Est\u00e9e Lauder has found a way to use WeChat as a CRM and social commerce platform.", "In a content-saturated media world, Chinese WeChat followers expect to receive more value-added services and experiences from brands.

On WeChat, the brand offers a wide range of customer-centered services. For example, followers can easily enroll in its loyalty program simply by providing their phone number. The second image above shows how users can receive customized beauty solutions. By clicking on the page, users will be automatically directed to a list of questions that require them\u00a0to provide information on their\u00a0age, skin condition, sleep quality, and more.

Opening its API to the public and continually rolling out new functionality has contributed to expanding the horizons of digitally active luxury brands. Over time, these new platform services, and the ease of connecting WeChat to external databases thanks to its API, led WeChat to be viewed as an established service-oriented platform. Compared to other Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo, WeChat never limited itself to simple content broadcasting.", "Fully aware of this evolution and the opportunity it provided, luxury fashion brands started to develop WeChat-specific features through their official accounts, that took advantage of the added-value services offered by WeChat.", "", "Today, two-thirds of the luxury fashion brands active on WeChat now operate a service account, a step up from subscription accounts, which are primarily used by news and media entities. Gucci, for example, which was an early WeChat adopter, transitioned last month its subscription account, followed by hundreds of thousands of followers, into a new service account to better complement its basic content broadcasting activities. It\u2019s worth noting that\u00a0WeChat now allows users to upgrade an account from subscription to service.", "Above on the left is the message sent by Gucci to its followers, inviting them to follow the new service account. Upon scanning the QR code, users will be redirected to Gucci\u2019s new service account.", "Key differences between WeChat subscription and service accounts.", "Operating a service account without providing service-oriented features represents a missed opportunity and lack of alignment with consumer expectations. One of the first features that brands prioritized was anything that would generate in-store traffic, and the store locator was key to that.", "Today, 88 percent of luxury fashion brands active on WeChat offer a store locator feature. User experience of such features was a challenge in the past (with Google Maps blocked or partially working in China), but we now observe that 73 percent are offering this service through the integration of a local map solution (Baidu Maps, Tencent Maps or Gaode), rather than Google, in order to guarantee an optimal user experience. In addition, 76 percent are offering location-based services, allowing users to directly find a nearby store or directions on how to get there.", "", "The above is a great illustration that brands are now ready to invest in developing the right solutions to support their customer experience, but digging deeper also shows areas where brands can improve. Among the sample of \u00a0brands analyzed, two-thirds are not providing any customer service on WeChat, meaning that in some cases, automated answers would redirect the user to a hotline or the corporate website\u2019s FAQ, and in even worse scenarios, questions were simply left unanswered.", "", "Another relevant illustration is O2O (the acronym for online-to-offline, also referred to as \u201comni-channel\u201d in the West) and how brands are trying to take advantage of WeChat to generate a transaction, or at least stimulate the act of purchase, by driving traffic to both online or offline point of sales. While it may not be a surprise to see that only 24 percent of the luxury fashion brands analyzed were integrating call-to-actions and links to an e-commerce platform, no brands currently offer the possibility to set up an appointment in-store or request a call-back from the sales staff.", "Another major surprise regarded the development of CRM programs through WeChat since only 16 percent of the brands analyzed were providing their users with options to join a loyalty program or simply to register their profile as a client.", "Example of Cartier\u2019s appointment feature on WeChat.", "Last but not least, when analyzing the performance of the store locator functions on WeChat, we realized that only 18 percent provided a service that worked abroad which, when we think about it, is a situation during which a customer would need even more help than when they shop in their home country.", "All in all, the below illustration well summarizes a situation where brands are indeed embracing WeChat and its promise to serve users, but it also shows that a serious commitment to get things right by really understanding customer expectations is required to approach WeChat in a mature way. Online and social CRM have been at the core of most of the strategic discussions led by luxury brands when it comes to WeChat, but it seems that there is still a long way to go before developing WeChat strategies for fashion luxury brands that really goes the way of the users.", "* Data collected by Digital Luxury Group on WeChat on December 31st, 2016, sample of 25 luxury fashion brands include: Balenciaga, Bally, Berluti, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Chanel, Chlo\u00e9, Christian Dior, Coach, DKNY, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Givenchy, Gucci, Herm\u00e8s, Kenzo, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Prada, Saint Laurent, Thomas Pink, Valentino"]}, {"title": "Report: Luxury Brands in China Trail Behind in Digital Proficiency", "meta": "March 7, 2017", "paragraphs": ["Chinese luxury shoppers are possibly the most tech-savvy and digitally friendly consumers in the world.

It also has opened stores on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall, as well as launched an online boutique on WeChat. The brand has also made substantial efforts in offering high-quality customer service and style advisory through phone and social media channels, as well as integrating online and offline shopping experiences. Burberry\u2019s wide e-commerce footprint is in contrast with its rivals, such as Gucci, Prada, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton, which have not yet established any direct e-commerce.", "On the e-commerce front, the study also notes that, in general, Western luxury brands that are willing to sell through this channel tend to go to platforms such as JD.com, Secoo.com and 5lux.com, but keep away from launching flagship stores on Tmall and boutiques via WeChat. One explanation could be that many luxury brands still find it hard to work with Alibaba, as their businesses in China have all, to some extent, suffered from the counterfeit phenomenon on that platform.", "When it comes to the level of localization, Coach, Hugo Boss and Ray-Ban are leading, followed by Armani, Burberry, Cartier, Dior and Michael Kors. A high level of localization requires a brand to pay attention to things such as language and currency, and establish\u00a0official presence on major Chinese sites such as Baidu, WeChat, Weibo, and Youku. Meanwhile, local celebrities and fashion bloggers also play a significant role in helping to localize the brands. For example, Burberry has been working closely with Chinese singer and actor Kris Wu, while Cartier uses singer Lu Han to promote their products.", "The availability of \u201cstyle advisory\u201d is also used as a benchmark to measure brands\u2019 digital performance.

However, European luxury brands are far from fully capitalizing on opportunities to meet the demands of China\u2019s online shoppers, according to a new report by ContactLab and investment company Exane BNP Paribas.", "Their joint study, The Online Purchase Experience China 2016, explores how brands are handling e-commerce processes, from communication\u00a0and ordering, to return policies and procedures. To collect the data, they tracked purchases and deliveries in Xiamen in August 2016 from 10 different purchasing points: three monobrands (Armani, Tod\u2019s, and Burberry), four e-tailers (Mr. Porter, Burberry on Tmall, Burberry on JD.com, and Burberry on Secoo), one department store (Yintai.com) and two WeChat stores (Montblanc and Chanel).", "The report reveals that the European luxury brands in the study do not always adapt their e-commerce strategy to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs. Instead, in many cases, their China operations are similar to that of their Western ones. For example, Armani and Tod\u2019s standalone website\u2019s designs\u00a0are nearly the same in China as they are for their U.S. sites, according to the report. Burberry, meanwhile, \u201cmakes an extra effort to personalize web content\u201d by featuring collaborations with Chinese celebrities and KOLs, as well as China-exclusive campaigns on their homepage.", "One of the most significant highlights of the study revolves around the fact that a large majority of China\u2019s online shoppers are making purchases on their phones. Brands that are more in tune with this trend are adopting mobile communications services as part of their purchasing experience. This is apparent with China\u2019s major e-commerce giants, who use WeChat and SMS to message shoppers purchase confirmations and returns information.", "The monobrands in the study, meanwhile, still heavily use email as a primary form of communication, all requiring shoppers to supply their email address for logging\u00a0in to make a purchase. Burberry, for example, while having \u201cthe most complete set of communications,\u201d does every step via email, aside from a phone call before delivery. In contrast, JD.com also has a similar in-depth communications strategy, but all steps are conducted via SMS and phone calls.", "When it comes to the ordering itself, Chinese consumers have different expectations than online shoppers in the West: They expect the delivery to arrive in under two days and returns to be free. To satisfy this, Burberry\u2019s online site promises delivery within one to five days, as well as the option for in-store pickup. During the period studied, Burberry actually delivered their products within two days.

While places like Eastern Europe and Scandinavia provided some bright spots last year, Chinese tourist favorites such as France and Germany both saw Chinese arrivals drop as the negative effects seemed to predominantly affect destinations in Western Europe.", "Dwindling Chinese tourism numbers to such destinations can only mean bad news for the United Kingdom, and it seems like the effect may have been larger than many people anticipated. Or rather, the cheaper pound that followed the Brexit referendum mitigated the effects to a much smaller extent than media reports would have people believe.", "", "Curiously, however, is the fact that Chinese tourists didn\u2019t only visit in smaller numbers, but also spent significantly less than the year before. While the cheaper pound that followed the Brexit referendum may have led to a drop in prices across the board immediately after the referendum, a quick harmonization of prices by luxury brands didn\u2019t make the UK a bargain hunter\u2019s dream for long. For Chinese tourists simply looking to acquire luxury products cheaper than at home, short-haul destinations with easier visa restrictions proved more cost effective for most of 2016\u2014in spite of the Brexit referendum.", "As time progresses, the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the cheaper pound keep dissipating as prices of goods are adjusted to reflect the lower exchange rate. With the cheaper pound not doing enough to boost Chinese tourism beyond 2015\u2019s numbers even in the period that immediately followed the referendum, the future looks even murkier. For the UK, it\u2019s clear that more than an improved exchange rate is required to keep Chinese tourist arrivals\u2014and spending\u2014growing.", "If that proves difficult now, it doesn\u2019t bode well for when the United Kingdom does leave the European Union. With the UK not part of the European Union, Chinese tourists in the UK risk losing out on some of the benefits\u2014such as not having to fear customs duty when crossing a European border\u2014while still conflating security concerns in Western Europe with those of the United Kingdom.

Despite the increase in spending at home, luxury shopping certainly won\u2019t cease to be a favorite pastime for outbound Chinese travelers anytime soon. One of the main factors driving the next hot shopping spot? Currency. Despite new tariff policies, some brands lowering their China prices, and a devalued yuan, many goods still cost more in China than they do elsewhere, and Chinese shoppers are very aware of prices and global currency fluctuations. When the pound plunged because of the Brexit vote this year, Chinese tourists flocked to the UK to scoop up lower-priced goods, while their currency-driven \u201cexplosive shopping\u201d in Japan calmed when the yen rose in value.", "3. E-commerce will remain a bright spot for growth with a focus on mobile. E-commerce is gaining ground globally in the luxury industry, and China is no exception.

You look to the future by re-defining the past.\u201d", "As Bizzarri tells it, the moment he walked the hallowed corridors of Gucci\u2019s HQ, he saw walls covered in images of the company\u2019s historic past. \u201cI took a position. \u2018Get rid of them,\u2019 I told my people. They talked too much about craftsmanship and quality. Those are a given for Gucci.\u201d", "He may have frightened the horses with this immediate gesture, and seeing he had 11,000 people to communicate a story of change to, he asked to see the design team, to reassure them about the future. That future included appointing a new design director to replace Frida Giannini.", "One of those sent to him by HR was Alessandro Michele, who joined the company in 2002 and was the associate creative director for accessories. ", "\u201cWe were to have a coffee,\u201d said Bizzarri. \u201cAlessandro was so nice, so humble, so relaxed. Four hours later we were deep in discussion. He had been hired by Tom Ford, and I puzzled how he could be in the company for more than 12 years and have a completely different opinion of what it should be, and what it was. I called (Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault) and said, \u2018I think we have the right guy.\u2019\u201d Bizzarri had found the design director within the company.", "\u201cI was wiling to take a risk.

People with a big ego should disappear.\u201d ", "Bizzarri asked Michele if he could deliver a men\u2019s collection in five days. He did. The women\u2019s collection followed one month later.

", "Despite the massive pressure on Michele to deliver that first collection in less than a week, Bizzarri is mindful of the unrelenting demands on designers and the need for a work-life balance. To than end he chose the New York Times conference to announce that in future Gucci would present both men\u2019s and women\u2019s fashion in a single presentation, to be held in the new Milan headquarters, in via Mecenate. He said the move would\u00a0 significantly help to simplify aspects of the business and most importantly allow time to foster creativity.", "Gucci\u2019s rising sales, and Michele\u2019s reputation as the new design director were initially cemented by electrifying comments online by young KOLs (key opinion leaders) and bloggers. Establishment journalists were tepid in their first reviews. ", "Bizzarri defers to their clout. \u201cThere was a speed of acceptance, through social media. It was rapid. Social media helped us communicate our message faster.\u201d ", "As a fellow panelist, Andrew Keith, who is President of Lane Crawford remarked, \u201cBrands who use social media to create emotional content for consumers connect with success. Every consumer wants to feel a personal relationship with the brand.\u201d", "Keith, whose company reaches young, hip Chinese clients, said Lane Crawford responds with immediacy to their ever-increasing use of technology.

The development and instrumentalization of celebrity by the Chinese Communist Party, the state, and business actors is motivated and sustained by the \u201cspiritual vacuum\u201d created by the emerging market socialist system and its associated societal dislocations and aspirations. Chinese celebrities are vehicles for the Party-state\u2019s inculcation of nationalism, traditional virtues, and the pursuit of modernity.", "Whereas Western celebrities\u2019 public transgressions sometimes prompt popular debate about whether singers or soccer players should be considered role models, no such discussion is necessary in China. As an editorial in the state-run newspaperPeople\u2019s Daily put it, \u201cAs public figures, celebrities have a huge influence on society, and are often imitated by fans. Although their social responsibility as public figures is not clearly stipulated, it is very much a moral issue.\u201d", "The Chinese celebrity industry is a product of the emergence of the \u201cmarket socialist\u201d economy. Economic reforms and urbanization, increasingly widespread prosperity, and the associated rise of consumerism, commercialization of the media and technological change, the growth of individualism, and decline of socialist ideology have all contributed to the emergence of a celebrity industry and culture in China. The consolidation of a media and entertainment system combining control and commercialization during the rule of former President Hu Jintao (2002-2012) created the dual constituencies of the Party-state and the public. With the removal of state subsidies, but not state restrictions on content, the media and entertainment industries were compelled to adopt advertising-led business models while keeping content within deliberately vague and moving boundaries set by the Party-state. Commercial soft entertainment formats (pop music, chat shows, reality TV, action movies) were generally a safe way of achieving both ends, with insatiable demand arising from Chinese audiences used to and tired of a diet of serious but dull political fare.", "Expanded media and entertainment scenes provided opportunities for outside celebrities, particularly actors and singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan, to establish themselves in China. The subsequent growth of domestic entertainment sectors and the professionalization of other components of the celebrity industry (notably advertising and PR) have accompanied the large-scale fabrication of domestic celebrities.", "Ubiquitous popular exposure has imbued individual performers with wealth, visibility, and influence within large fan bases. We would even go as far as to say that major Chinese celebrities are an embodiment of \u201csoft power,\u201d which, fundamentally, is the power of attraction. This celebrity soft power is derived from carefully packaged looks, persona, lifestyles\u2014and often the merging together of artistic roles and reality. It is their attractiveness as aspirational symbols that underpin the Party-state\u2019s regulation and instrumentalization of celebrities. The celebrity industry operates within an interlinked commercial, technological, legal and political structure, with official discourses embedding celebrity culture in broader narratives around patriotism, progress, and stability. Guided from on high within the Party by the Central Publicity Department, the Ministry of Culture and the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television decide who performs when, where, and under what circumstances, and have the power to determine celebrity appearances across the Chinese media-scape, including prohibiting media from featuring \u201ccelebrities embroiled in scandals.\u201d In 2008, for instance, the Party banned media coverage of Tang Wei (\u6c64\u552f), a Chinese actress who starred in Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee\u2019s (Li An \u674e\u5b89) Lust, Caution (Se, Jie \u8272, \u6212) after the film was criticized by the central government for \u201cglorifying traitors and insulting patriots.\u201d As this case suggests, Chinese celebrity is deeply embedded within the Party\u2019s nationalistic project after 1989, when a democracy movement centered on Tiananmen Square presented the Party with its most direct challenge since its rise to power. Actress Zhang Ziyi (\u7ae0\u5b50\u6021), whose global stardom is predicated on having become the embodiment of the new, global China was similarly censured for playing the paramour of a Japanese man in Memoirs of a Geisha, a Hollywood production of an American novel. Zhang, a Global Ambassador for the Special Olympics, was accused of \u201cbetraying national loyalties\u201d and subject to online abuse when naked images of her on set with Japanese co-star Ken Watanabe were posted maliciously on China\u2019s popular Tianya Internet forum.", "Beyond a comprehensive formal regulatory framework and extensive informal connections between state and commercial enterprises throughout the industry, it is also shaped by a range of \u201ccarrot-and-stick\u201d methods that seek to co-opt celebrities into behaviors aligned with the state agenda. Celebrities who do so can thrive. According to Forbes, Actress Fan Bingbing\uff08\u8303\u51b0\u51b0\uff09and notably apolitical Taiwanese pop singer and actor Jay Chou\uff08\u5468\u6770\u502b\uff09both earned more than 100 RMB in 2014. Actor Jackie Chan (\u6210\u9f99) and former NBA player Yao Ming (\u59da\u660e) are among 30 celebrities selected to the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference\u2014a sort of lay advisory to China\u2019s legislators\u2014and enjoy close ties with Chinese business communities. Celebrities such as Chan and Yao are conservative status quo figures whose celebrity has been incorporated into the prevailing power structure. Foreign celebrities who \u201churt the feelings of the Chinese people\u201d or domestics celebrities whose behavior transgresses accepted norms (e.g. by criticizing the state) or find themselves banned from media coverage, and shows and endorsements are cancelled, or they are forced to make public apologies and spend time under arrest or in jail. The dominant message transmitted by Chinese celebrities from Alibaba CEO Jack Ma (\u9a6c\u4e91) to action movie star Jet Li (\u674e\u8fde\u6770) is that persistence, cultivation of talent, and compliance within the status quo of the CCP regime are rewarded with financial, social, and symbolic power. Punishment awaits those who don\u2019t comply, by criticizing the regime or by partaking in the less salubrious aspects of urban life. Actor Huang Haibo \uff08\u9ec4\u6d77\u6ce2\uff09spent six months in \u201ccustody and education\u201d in 2014 for soliciting sex, reflecting upon release that \u201cas a public figure, I failed as a role model,\u201d echoing the language used by the state media to report his fall. Rising star Taiwanese actor Kai Ko (\u67ef\u9707\u4e1c) was arrested in 2014 with Hong Kong actor Jaycee Chan (\u9648\u7956\u660e), son of Jackie Chan (\u6210\u9f99) for using marijuana after having appeared in anti-drug advertisements. Ko and Chan\u2019s movies were briefly banned, and Kai made a tearful public apology after release from a two-week detention in Beijing.", "The creation and consumption of celebrity in China is anything but a mindless act. It is a site of learning in which the \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d of the people are aligned to prescribed ways of behaving, including exhibiting the \u201cmiddle class values\u201d underpinning former President Hu\u2019s \u201charmonious society\u201d and current President Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of the \u201cChinese Dream.\u201d Celebrities contribute to this project by embodying aspirational ways of urban modernity. The Party-state attributes a range of \u201cresponsibilities\u201d that come with celebrity status, adding specific layers of regulation to individual celebrity conduct to reinforce the multidimensional controls already prevailing over the media, Internet, cultural outputs, and society in general. The Party also has an appreciation of the utility of the mechanics of contemporary celebrity creation, incorporating lessons from professional PR, marketing, and advertising into a hybrid celebrity-propaganda system used to promote some state actors and state-sanctioned role models.", "For many would-be performers the long road to success begins with admission into one of China\u2019s state-run performing arts academies. A great majority of musicians and actors attended a state conservatory, dance, or drama academy, which act as incubators for the industry talent pool. Actresses Gong Li (\u5de9\u4fd0) and Zhang Ziyi (\u7ae0\u5b50\u6021) each was famously discovered by film director Zhang Yimou (\u5f20\u827a\u8c0b) while attending Beijing\u2019s Central Academy of Drama (Zhang graduated from the Beijing Film Academy). Action movie stars Jet Li (\u674e\u8fde\u6770) and Jackie Chan honed their trademark martial arts skills at academies for wushu and drama. Discovery by a talent agency particularly a major player like the Huayi Brothers film and media conglomerate (\u534e\u8c0a\u5144\u5f1f)\u2014which represents actresses such as Li Bingbing (\u674e\u51b0\u51b0) and actor Chen He (\u9648\u8d6b)\u2014is a ticket to film roles, recording contracts, and endorsement deals. Chinese celebrities endorse everything from DeBeers diamonds (Zhao Wei \u8d75\u8587) to White Rabbit Acne Cream (G.E.M. \u9093\u7d2b\u68cb), with some individuals representing a dozen or more brands. Numerous Chinese celebrities, including actresses Li Bingbing (\u674e\u51b0\u51b0) and Zhou Xun (\u5468\u8fc5), and Olympian Liu Xiang (\u5218\u7fd4), have gained global recognition as representatives for Gucci, Chanel, and Nike respectively. Celebrity endorsements are closely monitored by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce under its Code of Advertising Ethics. The national Advertising Law, first launched in 1995, was updated in 2015 to include liability provisions for celebrity appearances in advertisements. Failure to comply can result in fines, confiscated fees, or bans from acting as a product spokesperson. The law is a response to numerous celebrity endorsements that were misleading or connected to faulty products. A notorious case involved infant formula produced by the state-owned Sanlu Group (\u4e09\u9e7f\u96c6\u56e2) that was tainted with melamine and killed six and harmed 300,000 children in 2008. Actress Deng Jie (\u9093\u5a55) had appeared in TV advertisements saying, \u201cI trust Sanlu milk powder.\u201d", "In addition to the overweening attention of the state and the self-protective measures employed by the industry in their dealings with individual performers, celebrities are also expected by the state, the industry, and consumers to conform to dominant social norms such as frugality, filial piety, faithfulness, and the collective good, both on and off-stage. The celebrity wedding provides an illustration. When actress/ballerina Liu Shishi (\u5218\u8bd7\u8bd7) married Taiwanese singer/actor Nicky Wu (Wu Qilong \u5434\u5947\u9686) in March, it was widely reported across all major media outlets and was an extensive trending topic on social media. While commercial outlets obsessed over Liu\u2019s dress and the venue (the Indonesian island of Bali), the state-run\u00a0People\u2019s Daily report focused instead on the parents\u2019 hope that the couple would quickly have a child and on the diamond that Liu gave as a \u201cfilial gift,\u201d while China Daily honed in on how the couple had knelt before their parents and served them tea. However, when starlet Angelababy (\u6768\u9896) married actor Huang Xiaoming (\u9ec4\u6653\u660e) in 2015, the groom was forced to defend the extravagance of the ceremony held at Shanghai Exhibition Center, which featured 2,000 guests, a three meter-high cake, a five-carat diamond ring, and cost a reported $31 million.

Official policies to spur buying at home this year have included the announcement of two rounds of tariff cuts, the development of duty-free shopping, and a tougher crackdown by customs on smugglers. However, a massive number of Chinese travelers (and students) are making huge profits by selling luxury items from abroad over their WeChat accounts, and it\u2019s going to be impossible for customs to intercept the vast majority of small-scale sellers. Only a handful of luxury brands\u2014including Chanel and Tag Heuer\u2014opted to lower their China prices over the past year even as currency fluctuations widened the price difference. As long as it remains profitable to sell and a bargain to buy daigou items, the market will remain strong in the coming year.", "3.

In China, this spending shift doesn\u2019t just include gym memberships (and hot new outfits for requisite gym selfies), but also increased investment in products like foreign nutritional supplements, imported foods, air purifiers, and pollution masks as awareness of food safety and pollution issues grow. And this doesn\u2019t include the huge amounts that travelers are willing to spend on medical tourism for everything from plastic surgery to maternity. While the ultra-wealthy are heading to doctors in the United States, Japan, and Europe, China\u2019s middle class is also upping their medical tourism spending in more affordable places like South Korea and Taiwan.", "4.

And they decided that this was what they loved. So you see this evolution with a lot of Chinese customers, with the way they style themselves, and for me it\u2019s really encouraging because they\u2019re stepping out of the comfort zone, they\u2019re making bolder choices with a lot of their everyday wear, style etc.", "Do you have a lot of customers coming to you through Weibo and WeChat?", "In the beginning, a lot came through Weibo, definitely.

This has coincided with an unrelenting China slump for Swiss luxury watch sales brought on by the ongoing anti-corruption campaign.

Although details are sparse, a trial run of the tariff-slashing scheme is planned for July, and the cut for imported goods will be joined by a decrease in the current 30 percent consumption tax for select goods.", "This is likely a breath of fresh air for foreign brands, which have had to deal with all sorts of crazy market conditions created by enormous price discrepancies between goods in mainland China and those elsewhere. They\u2019re the reason Chinese tourists and gray-market sellers alike can be seen lining up outside luxury stores across the world, buying up mass quantities of items not just as gifts for friends and family, but also to sell via unregulated online shops on Taobao or WeChat. As this has become a growing trend, luxury sales growth in China slowed to negative 1 percent last year.

Alongside sellers on Taobao who actually went to Hong Kong or France to pick up a real Chanel or Herm\u00e8s purse, there are those selling fakes\u00a0claiming to be real daigou purchases (complete with a faked receipt to trick buyers).

Retail sales saw a year-on-year growth rate of 10.2 percent March, which was down from 10.7 percent from January to February.

This has resulted in violent altercations that have been breaking out this year as locals take their anger out on the flood of mainlanders coming across the border to stock up on tariff-free goods. In order to try to quell the anger, the Chinese government imposed limits on the number of visits to Hong Kong from Shenzhen in mid-April.", "The size of the impact that the government\u2019s new regulations will have depends on the amount by which they decide to slash tariffs.

Rather, it\u2019s mainly about the way Western designers interpret Chinese culture, or \u201ca China that exists as a collective fantasy.\u201d\u00a0As the Met points out in its description of the event, much of this fantasy was driven by classic films set in 1920s, 30s, and 40s China\u2014and these often had highly problematic themes. For example, Suzie Wong\u00a0 is commonly criticized for racism and sexism,\u00a0while films starring famous Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong often portrayed her as either a \u201cpainted doll\u201d or a \u201cscheming dragon lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "An evening gown by Roberto Cavalli based on Chinese porcelain that will be on display at the Costume Institute\u2019s new exhibit, \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass.\u201d (Metropolitan Museum of Art)", "While many of the dresses being displayed don\u2019t go full-on \u201cdragon lady\u201d and often just take inspiration from films actually by Chinese directors or from Chinese artwork, most of the ones revealed so far do represent the sartorial equivalent of Orientalism, a term which historically referred to the study of a broad swath of territory referred to as the \u201cOrient,\u201d including Asia and the Middle East. When professor Edward Said published his groundbreaking book Orientalism in 1978, he pointed out the problematic side of works of art or literature deemed \u201cOrientalist,\u201d noting that they often relied on patronizing racial stereotypes of \u201cexotic\u201d or \u201cmystical\u201d \u201cEastern\u201d cultures that often portrayed them as static and backward. According to Said, Orientalism was out of touch with on-the-ground realities in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, despite being part and parcel of Europe\u2019s colonial enterprises in those places. In a recent interview with Vogue, Bolton agreed that many of the dresses on display at the exhibition fit the rubric of Orientalism, but he argues this isn\u2019t a negative when it comes to fashion because it represents \u201can exchange of ideas and an honored source of influence.\u201d", "For the fashion designers with pieces on display, it will ultimately be wealthy Chinese consumers who make the final judgment call on this issue\u2014with their wallets. Even if certain designs with Chinese elements don\u2019t come across as offensive, they won\u2019t resonate with consumers if they show a lack of understanding of Chinese culture. China can no longer exist just in fashion labels\u2019 fantasies if they want to stay in business, and the perception that a garment is culturally tone-deaf will now lead directly to decreased profits. Over the past decade, Chinese luxury spending has grown tenfold and represented 30 percent of the global luxury market in 2014, according to Altagamma and Bain. This has been a rapid and groundbreaking change, since they accounted for only 3 percent only 10 years earlier (a time when many of the dresses at the exhibit were created). That number is just the average, and is much higher for some fashion brands\u2014Chinese consumers make up 38 percent of Prada\u2019s customer base, 37 percent of Gucci\u2019s, and 35 percent of Bottega Veneta\u2019s and Burberry\u2019s, according to estimates from Exane BNP Paribas.", "Designers have already become acutely aware of this shift, and the exhibit itself makes this clear. For example, it features a 2013 dress created by Valentino as part of an 85-piece capsule collection exclusively for the China market, which was presented in a special Shanghai runway show. Rather than featuring outfits that looked like they belong on the set of a culturally insensitive 1960\u2019s movie about 1920\u2019s-era Shanghai, the collection gave a nod to Chinese aesthetics with a red color palette while presenting pieces that were realistically wearable by the average urban Chinese fashionista.", "In a recent interview with Bolton published in Vogue, designer John Galliano noted that he has made this shift consciously since he began including Chinese motifs in his designs decade ago. \u201cI was fascinated with the culture. In retrospect, I think it was because I knew very little about it. Before I visited China, it was the fantasy that drew me to it, the sense of danger and mystery conveyed through Hollywood,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cmuch later, I learned more about the real China through research\u2014paintings, literature, architecture.

The sharp devaluation of the Russian ruble saw double-digit drops in tourism to key cities and caused local consumption to plummet. Brazil\u2019s economy also showed a significant slowdown, followed itself by a significant devaluation against the U.S. dollar.

On working in China as a foreigner, Mauron suggests: \u201cBe humble enough to realize that you will never completely understand the market and that\u2019s why you need to be supported by strong local talents.\u201d", "Over coffee, Mauron discusses the ubiquity of KOLs, the real impact of the corruption crackdown, and the growing sophistication of Chinese consumers.", "What are some China-specific services you offer?", "When we do social media here, we emphasize much more on content creation, storytelling, and brand building. You don\u2019t have the same assets you have overseas; brands don\u2019t have a lot of ready content for the China market. The usage is not the same, practices are not the same, but in the end, it impacts more the tactics and the implementation than the nature of the service. It is similar for other digital marketing activities\u2014for example, SEO follows the same principles in theory, but practically speaking, a lot of things differ.", "Another thing that is different here is that in the end, even if e-commerce is a reality for luxury brands, the fact is many are not ready to operate their own e-commerce platform here. Third-party e-commerce platforms have more importance here. We have an increasing number of brands seeking support to leverage properly on these third-party platforms to complement their e-commerce strategy.", "What Burberry did with Tmall recently was a very good example of that.", "You sent fashion blogger Peter Xu to Baselworld. What is the importance of KOLs (key opinion leaders) when it comes to product endorsement?", "I don\u2019t like to speak about KOLs because it became such a buzz word in China. At some point, every blogger was calling himself or herself a KOL and anyone in China could have been a KOL.", "I feel you work with KOLs for a very specific purpose; you want to tap into a specific community and it\u2019s just about expanding reach into that community or you want to gain in credibility and develop your brand positioning through their image. Ideally, you want to do both, but not every KOL is relevant for this. On the other hand, it\u2019s less and less impactful because audiences are more skeptical about the authenticity of messages. It doesn\u2019t make KOLs less relevant, just more challenging to work with and get a good return on investment. So it\u2019s important to pick the right KOLs, ones who have credibility and a relevant position for the brand. It\u2019s more important than before to be careful when selecting them. The audience is very aware of how it works. If it\u2019s simply to ask them to share content such write something based on a press release, it\u2019s not impactful anymore. Now, there needs to be deeper engagement and content creation. Working at a very basic level such as basic post or repost on Weibo is not sufficient anymore; it requires a stronger commitment to develop projects such as a photo shoot or the design of a capsule collection.", "We have different KOLs serving different purposes. Consumers are becoming more sophisticated and it\u2019s not as easy as before. I think they are much more skeptical of promotional messages. Before, KOLs were the easy way of working around that. Now, KOLs can have the ability of making things more challenging and more legitimate as well. It\u2019s good.", "", "In your annual World Luxury Index, you list the ranking of most-searched luxury brands on the internet in China. What are some general trends in the past few years based on these findings?", "We have started to observe more stability. In the first reports, there would be massive change in the top 10 brands one year to the next thanks to a TV show or successful commercial campaign. It was very volatile. Now, there is more stability, but at the same time, we see a kind of fatigue of the mainstream brands. Once again, consumers are becoming more mature. Also, from the younger generation, there is a growing concrete willingness to stand out from the crowd and be different, which presents a risk to well-established brands. So there is more stability on the one hand. We can say now we have iconic luxury brands in China that are at the top and will stay at top for at least a few years, which was not true in the past. But while the market is becoming more mature and developing its own taste, there is a lot of opportunity for innovative brands to find their own niche and audience.", "Do you think wealthy Chinese consumers have moved beyond conspicuous consumption?", "There was a big trend in the past to oversimplify and say Chinese consumers liked to buy what would be seen, shown, to show their success with concrete symbols of wealth. Now it becomes more difficult to say. Some wealthy Chinese consumers will do that, but with the more mature and sophisticated consumers, experiences will become more appealing\u2014luxury lifestyle, food, and beverage.

Plenty of big brands are suffering because they became too popular too quickly. Chanel for example, resisted expanding too quickly and was not influenced too much by the low- hanging fruit, which explains the fact that they might be less challenged than other big brands that are suffering from a certain saturation.", "As Chinese consumers become more sophisticated, they seek greater exclusivity and authenticity. What type of brand messaging appeals to this?", "If you look at Weibo, and I don\u2019t know whether the problem stems from brands or agencies, the market is focused primarily on KPIs, which leads brands and agencies to work on campaigns to serve the sole purpose of recruiting more fans or generating more buzz. This leads to campaigns completely disconnected from the core brand message. When you see a luxury brand put out a campaign about reposting a message to win a brand\u2019s item, for instance, that might work for quickly growing a community, but there is a lack of qualitative consideration. Such numbers-driven campaigns could work for fast-moving consumer goods brands but not luxury, in my consideration.", "Why don\u2019t you think there is a homegrown international luxury brand yet and what will it take for one to develop?", "I think \u201cmade in China\u201d is still a challenge. There is a know-how here in terms of craftsmanship that is not recognized overseas. There is a global perception of \u201cmade in China\u201d that needs to be developed.", "I think we have proof every day that creativity is here, innovation is here. No matter what we like to say from a more overseas standpoint, we\u2019re definitely in a country with strong innovation.", "In terms of branding, there is a lot of work; brand image, message.", "I feel there is a learning curve that goes fast. It simply relates to the fact that the first Chinese brand appeared at the end of Communism. There simply is not the same history and experience as it was in the West. Iconic luxury brands in Europe and America are sometimes 100 years old. In China, anything with more than 10 years of history is already quite old. Of course, in China, there is a strong concept of tradition, heritage, and culture, but applying that to a commercial enterprise is a concept that is very new. I believe that is one reason. Building and promoting a brand is a new concept that at the local level has existed only a few years and at the global level is even more recent.", "What has been the greatest challenge in starting the China office?", "The key challenge, and it is very logical, was to win the trust of the local teams. As a laowai working for a foreign company, it is not easy to convince local teams that you can potentially help them at various levels. The other tough challenge is to concretely face the fact that a lot of your assets are not relevant in China.", "However, luxury brands realized quite fast that our goal was not to apply a Western recipe to the Chinese market, but more to leverage on our understanding of our clients and their industries in order to build and conceive relevant digital marketing operations. The fact that I am the only foreigner on the China team definitely helped to get that trust as well.", "What advice would you give to a foreigner thinking of starting a business in China?", "Be humble enough to realize that you will never completely understand the market and that\u2019s why you need to be supported by strong local talents. No matter your skills or experience, I really think it\u2019s impossible to make it in China if, as a foreigner, you are planning to leverage on your assets only. You need the help of people who were born and raised here.", "At the same time, it is important to not go for the other extreme. In the end, we are a foreign company, working for mainly foreign brands, our culture and differences versus a local company can also be a strength for our clients, so it\u2019s important not to deny this.", "It always comes back to the importance of having a good balance in China: between who you are and what you aim to bring as a foreigner on the one hand, and what you need to question or challenge about you and your business to make it successful on the other.

Needless to say, all of these companies take painstaking efforts to protect their brand globally from copyright infringement.", "However, it\u2019s not always so easy to do that in China, as was demonstrated last week when China\u2019s State Administration for Industry & Commerce announced online that Burberry\u2019s trademark for the pattern in China had become invalid on November 13. The ruling was based on a February 2012 application challenging Burberry\u2019s rights to the trademark, and although the site didn\u2019t state who had filed the challenge, it is speculated that it came from Chinese retailer Polo Santa Roberta, which has been embroiled in legal battles with Burberry over the pattern for nine years.

Firstly, part of the reason for its strong China growth is the fact that it has only been in the China market since 2010. This means the brand is more novel amongst consumers and has not become overexposed, as many experts state has happened to Louis Vuitton, which has seen lackluster China sales in recent quarters. Being new to the market is generally an advantage, but it also means that it is imperative that the company must work to establish a sense of its brand DNA amongst consumers, especially those with rising incomes in lower-tier cities who are new to the luxury market.", "A flood of legal Haymarket Check products may confuse customers, dilute the brand\u2019s image, and lead to overexposure before it can even become fully established. The effect of fakes on brand image is clearly being felt by Louis Vuitton, which just signed an agreement with Taobao to cut down on the proliferation of fakes. If Burberry loses the right to its signature tartan, it could take no such measure.", "This may sound like a grave situation for Burberry if it isn\u2019t able to win in its upcoming battle. However, the challenges are likely not insurmountable for several reasons. First of all, the trademark only relates to leather goods, not the brand\u2019s signature checked scarves and trench linings. In addition, fake products are already ubiquitous in China, including those bearing Burberry\u2019s pattern. The Chinese government hasn\u2019t been doing much to cut down on them even with the rights to the trademark, yet Burberry\u2019s sales have still been growing at a significant rate in the country.", "More importantly, this challenge comes at a time when Chinese consumers continue to become more focused on quality and heritage, and less on outward displays of wealth like logos, or in the case of Burberry, patterns. From Burberry\u2019s recent marketing efforts, it looks like the company has already taken note of this, focusing on promoting its \u201cArt of the Trench\u201d campaign to highlight the craftsmanship and design of its classic coat. In addition, losing its rights in China doesn\u2019t affect its goods outside the mainland, where Chinese luxury consumers do 60 percent of their luxury shopping. Buying guaranteed authentic Burberry products in London is likely to still hold a certain cachet that brands in China won\u2019t be able to take away for the near future just from using the checked pattern.", "With issues like rampant fakes being sold both online and off, trademark trolls, and China\u2019s confusing intellectual property laws, the foreign luxury market certainly faces challenges in the country.

Be a mega-luxury brand from Europe with a long history and heritage; go to China early; capitalize on lack of competition and lack of consumer sophistication; invest heavily in people, infrastructure, and brand building; have the stomach to lose money for several years; break even; reinvest; expand; and then watch the profits grow.", "This model still has some merit, but so much has changed in China and with Chinese consumers over the last ten years that it\u2019s no longer enough to ensure success.", "The truth is that the formula for success has gotten much more complicated: by e-commerce, diversification of luxury consumer demographics, fiercer competition, the cost of doing business, and a more global Chinese luxury consumer.

Taking the strategy seriously, the company went local by selecting its Chinese name Luyi Weideng\u00a0(\u8def\u6613\u5a01\u767b). Later, in November 2012, the French luxury brand led the rest of its peers by joining the Wechat public platform in Sina Weibo, in contrast to competitors who thought that Wechat and Tencent Weibo users were too \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201clow-consumption.\u201d Louis Vuitton, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t resist reaching the 200 million WeChat users and an increasing number of mobile clients.

The average vacancy rate for malls in second-tier cities\u00a0is currently 10.5 percent, and much higher in individual cities such as Shenyang, where the rate stands at 17 percent.

Yet despite developments like the government-led crackdown on conspicuous consumption by officials \u2014 a development largely led by online scandals \u2014 as well as a shakeout in the Chinese e-commerce market, more luxury purchases being made overseas, and more discerning auction buying by new Chinese art and wine collectors, 2012 was less a break from in 2011 and more an intensification of its macro-level trends. However, this doesn\u2019t mean 2012 was simply a natural continuation of 2011. Despite strong marketing pushes and more brick-and-mortar expansion into China this year, many brands saw more restrained buying among mainland Chinese consumers than in years past, indicating that economic fluctuations and slower economic growth in China could indeed be crimping demand. At the same time, more scrutiny on government officials\u2019 buying and gift-giving habits hit some brands harder than others, with several watchmakers and winemakers in particular seeing a dip in sales in the second half of the year.", "Still, despite a somewhat tougher year, most luxury brands remain optimistic about China, and for good reason. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, Prada sales in China leapt 33 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of the year, with the brand also attributing a 54 percent year-on-year increase in its Europe sales to Chinese tourists. Even at the end of this summer, as some brands showed a steep decline in sales, others such as Herm\u00e8s and L\u2019Oreal, and luxury groups LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and PPR, boasted double-digit growth that defied observer fears of a sharp China drop-off. Recently, the Boston Consulting Group asserted that China will have surpassed the United States as the second-largest personal luxury market by 2015, accounting for $87 billion, 23 percent of the global market, and become the largest personal luxury market by 2020. Others, such as Bain, hold that China has already become the world\u2019s largest luxury market.", "The Long Museum, China's largest private museum, recently opened in Shanghai", "In China\u2019s art market, which overtook the United States to become the world\u2019s largest art and antiques market in terms of auction and dealer sales in 2011, according to The European Fine Art Foundation, 2012 was also a more complex year for major auction houses. However, a hopeful sign for international players like Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, and increasingly global Chinese houses like China Guardian and Beijing Poly, is that Chinese collectors have not lost their appetite for high-priced, top-tier art and antiques. While demand for blue-chip Western art remains highly niche in auction hubs like Hong Kong, mainland Chinese collectors have continued to home in on well-known traditional Chinese ink painters, modernist \u201cbrand-names,\u201d and blue-chip contemporary Chinese artists even as bidding and buying has become more selective. As in 2011, much of the action in the Greater China art world was seen in Hong Kong, where Sotheby\u2019s opened a large new multi-use space this past April and China Guardian raised an impressive HK$354 million (US$45.7 million) in its inaugural sale in the city this fall. Though Beijing announced plans to build a freeport designed to make the Chinese capital a regional arts powerhouse, at the moment Hong Kong remains the auction epicenter of Asia, and we expect this will remain unchanged in 2013.", "From our perspective, the complexities of the China luxury and art markets in 2012, and what they mean for 2013, can be partly illustrated by these five trends:", "1. Conspicuous Consumption May Be Down Now, But Look For an Uptick In 2013", "A much-publicized crackdown by the central government in Beijing, and recent announcements forbidding lavish ceremonies and celebrations may be spooking China\u2019s top baijiu makers and major luxury brands that now rely on China sales, but we don\u2019t expect austerity to become the name of the game among China\u2019s wealthy next year. While the recent anti-corruption drive could dent luxury segments most often used for gift-giving purposes, one thing to keep in mind is that China is large, diverse, populous, and has a massive rising middle class that wants (often very conspicuous) high-end brands. In the year ahead, look for the inland middle-class, second-tier entrepreneurs, the stereotypical \u201ccoal bosses\u201d and other emerging luxury buyers within China to remain conspicuous in their consumption. Also, don\u2019t expect powerful, wealthy demographics in power centers like Beijing to stop buying luxury goods in 2013 after years of doing so. They\u2019ll just change their behavior in other ways.", "Blancpain is one of the Swiss watchmakers that hopes to catch the post-Rolex Chinese buyer", "2. Top-Tier Consumers Going Obscure Amid Greater Scrutiny", "Though newly wealthy shoppers in second-, third- and fourth-tier cities may just be buying their first Louis Vuitton wallet in 2013, greater scrutiny among co-workers or superiors will continue to drive China\u2019s top-tier consumers towards boutique or obscure luxury brands. We expect this to be particularly true in the luxury watch and handbag markets. Signs are there, not just in China but around the world, that China\u2019s more savvy shoppers are going niche in rising numbers. Though the vast majority of outbound Chinese tourist-shoppers \u2014 whether seen in Tsim Sha Tsui or the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2014 continue to line up outside Chanel, Gucci or Louis Vuitton, less obvious (yet still famous) watchmakers like Breguet, heritage American shoemakers like Allen Edmonds, and top suitmakers on Savile Row are all welcoming more Chinese customers.", "3. The Promise of Luxury E-Commerce Still Largely Unrealized", "If China\u2019s luxury market as a whole became more complicated this year, its nascent luxury e-commerce market became even more so. Following a raft of investment and new entrants to the nebulous market in 2011, competition became far greater over the course of a turbulent 2012, with American and European heavyweights such as Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus and Net-A-Porter hitting the market with full-price, O2O models for China and teaming up with Chinese luxury sites\u00a0including VIPStore\u2019s\u00a0Omei,\u00a0Glamour Sales, and\u00a0Shouke. At the same time, individual brands like Coach, Zara, and J. Crew (in partnership with Lane Crawford) expanded into the China e-commerce market.", "The Zara mainland China online store launched on September 5", "To compete, Chinese e-tailers spent the better part of the year prioritizing exclusive brand partnerships, with Shangpin\u00a0collaborating with the likes of Sergio Rossi, M Missoni, Diane Von Furstenberg and Stuart Weitzman\u00a0as well as\u00a0more niche American labels\u00a0like Cynthia Rowley, Laundry by Shelli Segal, Charlie Jade,\u00a0Tracy Reese\u00a0and\u00a0label Milly. Chinese consumers themselves are also far more discriminating and demanding of perks \u2014 whether that means free shipping, liberal return policies, or hard-to-get exclusives \u2014 and they know they can get them.", "Despite all this, it remains to be seen how long it will take for China\u2019s luxury e-commerce market to truly hit its stride, and for leaders to consolidate their position. In 2013, we expect to see quite a few casualties, particularly among domestic Chinese e-tailers, and expect full-price O2O models to show the greatest potential, particularly in top-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Inland, discounts will remain a top priority for middle-class consumers, and as such the \u201cWild West\u201d atmosphere of the Chinese luxury e-tail market will likely stay intact.", "4. Japanese Auto Brands Slump, German Brands Dominate, But UK & US Brands Catching Up", "The complexity of the Chinese auto market in 2012 is difficult to summarize, with Japanese brands taking a nose-dive following the flare-up of a long-simmering territorial spat with China, German automakers seeing muted rises in sales compared to the last several years, Jaguar Land Rover having one of its best years ever in China, and US brands like Cadillac catching on with a younger luxury consumer class via savvy use of social media. Though we expect German brands Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz to continue to rule the high-end of the market in 2013, greater competition from their American and British counterparts, and the aforementioned greater scrutiny regarding government luxury purchases, could make the year ahead more difficult for perennial leaders like Audi in particular.", "China's wealthy red wine lovers have turned to Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti over the past year", "5. Chinese Wine Demand Making Some Burgundy Lovers See Red", "China\u2019s wine market also showed signs of continued maturation in 2013, as well as signs of overcapacity due to a glut of (not always professional) importers. This was particularly apparent at the high-end of the market, which is as dominated by French winemakers as China\u2019s auto market is by German carmakers. While cashed-up wine newbies continued to home in on Bordeaux, the more educated buyer diversified his or her portfolio this year by investing even more in Burgundy, a development that hasn\u2019t pleased everybody. In the wake of the Bordeaux boom and (muted) bust of 2010-2011, which saw prices for the likes of Ch\u00e2teau\u00a0Lafite hit new highs owing to skyrocketing Chinese demand, some\u00a0producers in Burgundy worry that too great an emphasis on the China market could ultimately hurt their prospects in traditional markets. (And hurt them as well if Chinese interest wanes and prices drop.) As Burgundy specialist\u00a0Laurent Gotti recently told Le Parisien,\u00a0\u2018\u2018After having made the market price of certain Bordeaux explode in an irrational manner, [Chinese buyers are] now logically interested in Burgundy and its niche wines\u2026They want everything that is the most expensive and are prepared to fork out incredible sums.\u201d", "Additionally, staking only three percent of total French wine production and experiencing lower harvest volumes in recent years, Burgundy \u2014 never a cheap wine \u2014 may grow even more pricey, a problem for bargain hunters. Thus, Burgundy wine may be facing opposite symptoms compared to cheese, as overwhelming Chinese investments are giving Burgundy drinkers everywhere a reason to fear a surge of speculative interest in the region and its wines. Burgundy\u2019s notoriously conservative wine-growers have also been alarmed by the growing interest in buying Burgundy real estate among Chinese investors. This summer,\u00a0outbidding a group of local vintners, Louis Ng, the 60-year-old Hong Kong COO of gambling tycoon Stanley Ho\u2019s SJM Holdings, purchased Ch\u00e2teau de Gevrey-Chambertin from the Miteran family in Burgundy\u2019s C\u00f4te de Nuits for a reported US$10 million, stirring a vicious backlash against foreign investments by some residents in Burgundy as well as greater France."]}, {"title": "Report: Chinese Interest In Luxury Watches Undiminished", "meta": "December 19, 2012", "paragraphs": ["The study looked at searches of 65 brands in a range of segments", "As observers keep a close eye on the China luxury watch market to see if this fall\u2019s leadership transition leads to a sales bump in the months ahead, a new report by the Digital Luxury Group (DLG), Europa Star and the Luxury Society indicates that Chinese interest in high-end timepieces remains high and growing.

This, DLG points out, is the cause of several factors, \u201cfrom a more educated consumer who is now deciphering between a brand\u2019s different models, to gift-purchase related searches which tend to skew more generic.\u201d A more educated consumer base is also creating new opportunities for watchmakers to get creative in tackling the market, beyond simply creating localized timepieces.", "A downloadable version of the report is available for free on the DLG site."]}, {"title": "Report: European Luxury Handbags Dominate In China", "meta": "November 21, 2012", "paragraphs": ["China is the third-largest country in terms of luxury handbag search volume", "This week, the\u00a0Digital Luxury Group (DLG) and the\u00a0Luxury Society published the 2012 WorldHandbagReport, analyzing over 120 luxury handbag brands in 10 of the world\u2019s top luxury markets, including Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States.

Fueling Chinese consumer demand for handbags are major European players such as Chanel, Gucci, and Herm\u00e8s. According to the report, nine out of the top 10 most sought-after luxury handbag brands in China are of European heritage, with American label Coach being the single outlier.", "Chinese shoppers are still fixated on European brands", "2. Louis Vuitton is the #1 luxury handbag brand globally, but has challenges ahead in key Asian markets:\u00a0Louis Vuitton attracts an impressive 15 percent of the global search volume for luxury handbags, with most of the interest coming from the US and France. Surprisingly, Louis Vuitton does not succeed in obtaining the top position in the major Asian markets of China and Japan, in spite of the brand being somewhat synonymous with luxury handbags in the region. One factor that may explain this, in Japan at least, is the fact that 85 percent of Japanese women already own items from the brand.", "European domination in terms of Chinese online searches should provide some reassurance for brand powerhouses like Burberry and Mulberry, who have had a rollercoaster few months to say the least. For others, Chinese demand may mean near future stability; however, we can certainly foresee some brands going down the same path that Louis Vuitton has encountered in Japan. As the Chinese shopper becomes increasingly seasoned, and the middle class continues its rise, the question brands encounter is no longer how to sell the Chinese consumer their first bag, but how to sell them their third or fourth. To this end, luxury stalwarts like Louis Vuitton will have to keep turning on their creative engines to stay in the spotlight."]}, {"title": "Accessible Luxury Brands Ride China\u2019s Middle-Class Wave", "meta": "October 24, 2012", "paragraphs": ["Karen Millen opened its first China flagship at Beijing's Parkview Green mall", "As the battle rages on between high-end and high-street brands in mainland China and Hong Kong, one ongoing trend to watch is the success of so-called \u201caccessible luxury\u201d or \u201caffordable luxury\u201d brands in the market, those that span the bridge between luxury and masstige.

With stiff luxury tariffs and a slew of additional taxes slapped on imported high-end items, luxury goods sold in China can cost upwards of 30-50 percent more than those sold in Europe, an issue that has, in recent years, led Chinese consumers to look abroad to buy their coveted brands, meaning more than half of all such purchases by these shoppers were made outside of China in 2011. Over the past year, even as some Chinese luxury consumers have cut back on their lavish spending in the face of slower macroeconomic growth (and a lull in conspicuous consumption), the price gap has only intensified. Factor in the euro\u2019s depreciating value \u2014\u00a0recently dropping 16 percent against the yuan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and top-tier brands are stuck straddling an even wider gap.", "From the Wall Street Journal:", "For one of Louis Vuitton\u2019s most iconic accessories, the popular Speedy 30 bag, customers at stores in Beijing or Shanghai will pay 6,100 yuan ($964), while the price tags in Europe is 500, or about $619.", "Likewise for Chanel\u2019s Timeless Classic Flap bag, which in France retails at \u20ac3,100, or $3,839.

(The second such increase in the past several months.)

Chinese tourists traveling to Europe in good faith that their favorite luxury items will be sold at more affordable prices could be discouraged from returning if the price gap is mitigated solely by price increases.", "Moreover, increasing prices in Europe could undermine purchases by domestic consumers as eurozone gloom continues to weigh on spending.

For now, luxury brands may want to focus their energy on pinpointing Chinese shopping habits. While some testimonials admit that inflated prices abroad may change their minds about booking their next shopping spree, the more prevalent consensus seems to be that the Chinese won\u2019t change their shopping habits in any dramatic way, but that many will just bite the bullet and make the purchase. Even if prices rise 10 percent in Europe for that Chanel handbag or Hermes scarf, they\u2019re still less pricey than they\u2019d be in Beijing. Those who have the\u00a0proclivity\u00a0to shop domestically in China will continue to do so, and those who venture abroad won\u2019t necessarily be making last minute cancellations on account of potentially higher prices.", "Knowing that China is in the midst of a growth spurt \u2014 albeit a less extreme one than in recent years \u2014 companies may want to reconsider how they can optimize sales in destinations that Chinese shoppers will definitely frequent until a mature balance is struck between European and Chinese prices.

While dedicated jewelers like Tiffany & Co., Harry Winston, Van Cleef & Arpels and others are seeing less of a sales boom this year than in 2010-2011, branded jewelry appeals to a somewhat wider audience, particularly in second- and third-tier cities where brand loyalty and knowledge is relatively low. As Caroline Reyl, manager of the Premium Brands fund at Pictet, told the FT, China will be a \u201csignificant source of growth\u201d for branded fine jewelry. According to this year\u2019s Worldwatch Report, hard luxury demand is rising quickly in China, with demand for luxury watches in China overtaking the United States for the first time.

To get married is to start a new family, and it also has an element of national stability to it, and I mean that in a cultural rather than\u00a0a political way. It\u2019s also not just a high-end thing for a\u00a0minority\u00a0of people, it\u2019s for everybody. ", "It\u2019s been 30 years since I first started off as a fashion student.

What\u2019s popular is man-made, intentional, designed to achieve business goals. It\u2019s a sort of summary of society. It needs a certain response from potential buyers, and eventually you start to see one response in the form of shanzhai (copycatting). If designers can be more original and individualistic, nothing will be \u201cpopular\u201d or trendy. ", "But what is fashion? Fashion reflects the tastes of this day and age.

I try to interpret national feelings. So I feel my designs are fashion. But I don\u2019t rely only on Chinese elements. I do believe, though, that classic elements need to work their way in organically, slowly infusing\u00a0themselves\u00a0into pieces.\u00a0I\u2019m not part of pop culture, although what I do may coincide with pop culture.\u00a0", "Guo Pei \"Chinese Brides\" collection", "JD: During China Fashion Week, we saw a lot of recent works by Chinese designers.

I\u2019m not familiar with many young designers. ", "It\u2019s like being a painter. If you work in different styles, it\u2019s hard to say if another artist is good or bad. Everybody is doing something different. If I give an example of someone I kind of like, I could say a designer from my own generation, Ma Ke (\u9a6c\u53ef).

I think it\u2019ll happen naturally. If the hopes of other people exceed your ability to fill them, the pressure really builds. The way I feel is that if you go out into the world, it\u2019s best to be invited.

But it\u2019s this speed of change in the market \u2014 and the speed of brand expansion \u2014 that has been arguably the key factor leading to inconsistent customer service. Quite simply, there\u2019s been no time to bring standards up to international levels.

With the after-sales service infrastructure in China weak and strained due to rapid brand expansion, customer complaints are generally slowly, or inadequately, resolved. According to the survey results, after-sales complaints in China are on average more than 65 percent higher in China than in Europe.", "As the Chinese business site Afinance writes this week, many blame a chronic talent shortage for the relatively poor level of service in China. As a reporter from the Yangcheng Evening News told the site, \u201cMainland China lags behind the service levels of Hong Kong and Singapore because there\u2019s a dearth of talent. Early last year, one top international brand launched in Guangzhou and was offering an annual salary in the hundreds of thousands [of yuan] to find an experienced manager to take control, but it took them six months to find an appropriate candidate.\u201d", "Some are more hopeful that the after-sales and general customer service standards will improve in China over time as the industry matures.

Noting that both Chinese and international brands have had to change their long-standing policy of dumping low-end inventory on the mainland China market, the article holds that more discriminating shoppers have brought about a sea-change in the country\u2019s luxury market, which has long been plagued by a flood of counterfeits. According to a recent survey by the fashion brand Escada, Chinese consumer willingness to buy fakes has plummeted in recent years, from 31 percent in 2008 to only 12 percent in 2010. Quoting Max Magni, head of McKinsey\u2019s Chinese consumer goods practice in Shanghai, the FT adds that the market for luxury fakes is growing at a snail\u2019s pace compared to the authentic market, and companies are finding that Chinese consumers are simply getting harder to please.", "This shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise to anyone who has kept an eye on the market\u2019s fundamental development over the past few years.

High import and luxury taxes \u2014 which add upwards of 40 percent to the price of luxury goods in mainland China \u2014 necessitate higher prices for individual items, as do stratospheric rents, and as such brands can\u2019t simply stock unpopular leftovers that won\u2019t sell. But with China becoming such an important part of the global luxury market this year, as European consumption may slow this year, it pays to consider which luxury brands will benefit from a more brand-savvy, quality-minded Chinese consumer in 2012.", "Though, as the FT article points out, \u201cChinese shoppers still like an extra dose of bling on everything,\u201d a trend that we expect to see continuing to spread from top-tier to second- and third-tier cities is \u201clogo-less\u201d or less conspicuous luxury.

Less well-known (or counterfeited) in mainland China, but popular elsewhere in Asia as well as Europe and North America, these brands should see encouraging growth rates in China in the year ahead.

Longines sits around 10 meters away from a supermarket, and Omega shares a wall with a McDonald\u2019s. Still, this hasn\u2019t reduced the city\u2019s enthusiasm for luxury goods.

Do you think luxury consumers in Chengdu are more price-sensitive?", "OM: In my opinion, consumers who are able to afford luxury seldom complain about prices. They should have prepared themselves psychologically before hitting the mall, and have a rough sense of what they expect to spend. Moreover, the products they like to buy should be familiar to their friends and family. However, some customers have been known to complain about prices in Chengdu after buying similar items at a lower price in Hong Kong or overseas.

Around 2006 I started to create my own fashion brand, and after a couple of years I realized I didn\u2019t want to do that anymore. I\u2019d started collecting eyeglasses in 2003, and over the years had built up a collection of interesting designs.

Much of it went to luxury brands such as Hermes, Burberry and Prada. Louis Vuitton alone registered record sales of $138 million.

For one thing, Chengdu\u2019s luxury consumers are relatively young, largely female, and fairly knowledgeable about brands. This extends beyond Louis Vuitton and Chanel; the earliest stirrings of the two markers that Jing Daily would say denote a comparatively mature luxury market in China \u2014 a promising number of young and active local designers and strictly curated multi-brand retailers \u2014 are starting to appear in Chengdu. By 2014, Lane Crawford will open its first store outside of\u00a0Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong in Chengdu, and a handful of Chengdu natives, having studied fashion design in Beijing or abroad, are returning home with the intention of launching their own labels.", "A packed luxury market might be a vanity project for the city government, but the demand is clearly there, though we\u2019ll have to keep an eye out to see whether that demand will continue to be met by luxury giants like Gucci, LV and Hermes or by smaller labels like Kiton or Bottega Veneta.", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "100 Days In, Is Hainan\u2019s Duty-Free Experiment A Success?", "meta": "August 15, 2011", "paragraphs": ["Sanya Duty-Free Shop (Image: Hainan Online)", "As Jing Daily previously noted this April, Hainan island \u2014 China\u2019s southernmost province \u2014 recently launched a pilot duty-free program designed to boost high-end shopping, allowing domestic Chinese tourists to claim tax refunds on imported luxury goods purchased in Hainan up to a value of 5,000 yuan (US$762), with reduced tax rates for purchases exceeding 5,000 yuan.\u00a0Despite skepticism whether mainland Chinese shoppers would head to Hainan over other shopping havens like Hong Kong, this week, as the program nears its 100th day,\u00a0the city government of Sanya claimed on its official website that the program has been a runaway success.", "According to statistical data released by the Sanya government, the Sanya Duty-Free Store (\u4e09\u4e9a\u514d\u7a0e\u5e97) attracted 18,800 visitors on the first day of the\u00a0program\u00a0alone, among whom 5,619 purchases were made.

As the figures went on to point out, among the sales made at the duty-free shop this summer, 94.7 percent were eligible for duty-free status, and 88.16 percent of duty-free items sold were priced below 5,000 yuan (US$782) \u2014 the program\u2019s cut-off point.", "Travel agents have been quick to promote new Hainan travel packages heavy on duty-free shopping, and based on official Hainan tourism figures, the lure of cheaper luxury shopping may be enough for many mainland Chinese visitors.

Respondents noted that their annual income increased on average 11 percent last year, surpassing the consumer price index (CPI) increase of 6.4 percent.", "Luxury consumers in surveyed cities have moved on to a second phase of high-end consumption, in which their purchases are motivated by a desire to improve quality of life rather than simply show off. These consumers now have a better understanding of the value of luxury goods and more discriminating tastes. Seeing the added value of luxury goods, particularly during a time of economic uncertainty, they see the act of purchasing luxury goods as an act of \u201ccollecting,\u201d one that helps them express their identities and set themselves apart from the general public.", "Expenditure on jewelry and accessories currently accounts for 20.5 percent of total luxury consumption in China, with watches and leather goods making up a similar (but slightly smaller) percentage.", "As of this year, 51 percent of respondents chose Hong Kong as their preferred city for purchasing luxury goods, followed by major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, as well as Japan, Europe and the US.

One noticeable trend in the Chinese luxury market is that 67 percent of regular luxury consumers cite online shopping as their primary motive for Internet use, a massive shift that\u2019s only picked up steam over the past year. However, as Huicong points out, China\u2019s online shopping market is still young, and most of the high-end purchases made by respondents were small items.", "While respondents know how to spend money, they also know how to save and invest it. 32.8 percent of respondents invest a significant amount of their savings in stocks and funds. Huicong finds that gold is also becoming more popular among luxury consumers, accounting for around 20 percent of their total investments.", "Huicong finds that the top deciding factors that drive luxury consumption are brand (with 79.2 percent saying it\u2019s important), style (68.6 percent), and after-sales service (30 percent). Apart from quality, in terms of brand communication, respondents cite word-of-mouth as a validating factor. This, Huicong notes, is cultural, as \u201cChinese consumers have strong family values and like to do things as a group.\u201d Usually, the report adds, the leader of the family or group of friends serves as an \u201copinion leader,\u201d recommending what they like to the rest of the group.", "Huicong points out five attributes common to opinion leaders: 1.)

Despite the showpiece malls and comparatively high per capita income of Guangzhou residents, top brands have been slow to invest heavily in their Guangzhou operations, and for good reason: local luxury consumption lags far behind other key markets. As one luxury retailer told the Yangcheng Evening News this week, \u201cIn China, for many luxury brands, in terms of luxury consumption, the top cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian. Guangzhou is still not really in that top echelon.\u201d", "Still, brands continue to expand, or make their debut, in Guangzhou.

This indicates that the city\u2019s luxury consumption is finally putting it in the country\u2019s top tier. Guangzhou\u2019s luxury market grew rapidly after the city\u2019s hosting of the 2010 Asian Games, with Taikoo Hui [shopping mall] general manager Hao Jilin telling reporters that 70 percent of the brands at his mall are international. This is an eye-catching development.

The city also boasts Chanel\u2019s first location in south China, and Dior will debut its full line at its flagship this November. Since re-launching earlier this year, the Gucci store at La Perle has seen long queues every weekend. As a manager at La Perle pointed out, DKNY and Dior Homme will soon make their Guangzhou debut. As more brands set up shop at La Perle, sales continue to rise. According to a mall spokesman, sales of international top-level brands are increasing by 20 percent per month. ", "While it\u2019s one thing to base perceptions about Guangzhou\u2019s luxury market on the word of a mall spokesperson, the key to addressing whether the city is a good bet for major brands lies in consumer behavior. Up until now, Guangzhou\u2019s proximity to nearby, duty-free Hong Kong has been perhaps the greatest hindrance for luxury brands, as Guangzhou locals have traditionally preferred to simply pop over the border and buy high-end goods at a significant discount. But, as the Yangcheng Evening News holds, this may be changing.", "While Guangzhou\u2019s luxury consumers have the habit of heading to Hong Kong to buy high-end goods, this seems to be slowly changing. It\u2019s been reported that Guangzhou\u2019s regular luxury consumers spent on average 70,000 yuan (US$10,860) more in 2010 than they did the previous year on luxury goods. As a representative of La Perle mall explained, last year the mall\u2019s overall sales rose 25 percent.", "Ultimately, Guangzhou\u2019s sales boost seems to come primarily from the convenience factor.

Many shoppers come in here looking to buy a particular item, and don\u2019t even ask about the price\u201d.", "Cutting one tax among many might not be enough to dissuade Hong Kong-bound tourist-shoppers", "Although a spokesperson for Chanel said the price increases were mainly due to a spike in the price of raw materials like leather, and industry insiders have also pointed at the depreciation of the euro, Beijing Business Today is firmly convinced that the relative strengthening of the Chinese yuan, as well as the possible luxury tax reduction, are mostly to blame, writing:", "Industry insiders believe that after China\u2019s [rumored] import tax reductions, the retail price gap between major international luxury brands and domestic Chinese luxury brands will be lessened, and since these global brands worry that this would damage their high-end image, they want to increase prices pre-emptively.

While some super-rich mainland Chinese will continue to shop locally regardless of price increases (whether out of convenience, \u201cface\u201d or because they simply don\u2019t care), consumers who shop around, or head in groups to duty-free Hong Kong once or twice a year to load up on luxury goods, probably won\u2019t change their behavior even if luxury taxes are cut. As Jing Daily wrote last month, the Chongqing Evening News reported a cool reception among local shoppers to the tax cut rumors.", "According to the Evening News, few Chongqing residents were swayed by the idea of a luxury tax reduction, as they pointed out that China\u2019s luxury tax is only one of several fees tacked on to imported high-end goods.

Within the last year, possibly emboldened by the views LV\u2019s videos were getting, other brands like\u00a0Guerlain, Cartier and Longines launched their own channels, and in the first half of this year, Burberry streamed a live webcast of its Milan Fashion Show on Youku, helping its official channel reach over one million views. ", "As the Youku release suggests, digital marketing in China is perhaps more important than in more mature markets because China\u2019s luxury consumers tend to be far younger than their Western or Japanese counterparts. The \u201coverlap\u201d in the luxury consumer base and the user demographics of video sites like Youku, which are similarly youthful, means they\u2019re a marketing tool that\u2019s difficult to ignore. As Youku SVP, Frank Ming Wei, added, increasing their presence on video sites like Youku is a good strategy for luxury brands to reach consumers in more far-flung interior regions. Said Wei, \u201cOur nationwide reach is helping these brands make inroads into second- and third-tier cities where they had previously not had strong footholds.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Jiepang\u2019s LV virtual badge", "The growing digital presence of luxury brands in China is an interesting development, and in some ways we can view Louis Vuitton as something of a bellwether in this space. The curious question, however, is whether these efforts are actually paying off in terms of sales. While LV\u2019s tie-up with Jiepang was by most accounts a success, this success was partly due to the fact that many\u00a0Jiepang users simply wanted to display the free virtual LV badge on their profiles. This, of course, is something of a marketing success but if it doesn\u2019t influence actual sales, it\u2019s essentially a fun little gimmick. That said, it\u2019s a very important space to watch, and if brands start to use Jiepang or other services to offer special promotions, we could theoretically see a significant sales bump.", "Now, as more brands launch exclusive channels on video sites like Youku and go beyond simply posting in-video advertisements, we still have several questions: How will brands best use this platform to actually entice viewers to buy? Youku users may be young, but are they the correct\u00a0economic demographic? Are China\u2019s wealthy young luxury consumers actually influenced by this type of online marketing, or are their purchases driven by their peers?", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Breaking Down China\u2019s Booming Luxury Watch Market", "meta": "June 15, 2011", "paragraphs": ["China Brand Ambassador, Chen Daoming (Image \u00a9 TAG Heuer)", "According to the Bain & Co. 2010 Luxury Market Survey, Chinese domestic luxury consumption of over 200 global high-end brands totaled 68 billion yuan (US$10.2 million) in 2009, with most of that spending within the mid-price range (25,000-50,000 yuan, or US$3,857-7,714). But not all of that money went to fast cars and flashy apparel. Of the billions spent by Chinese consumers in 2009, a Research in China study found that US$2.2 billion went towards luxury watches, one of the most popular early purchases of the newly wealthy. Interestingly, Bain identified only five brands \u2014 Cartier, Longines, Omega, Rolex and Tudor \u2014 as accounting for roughly half of all watch sales in China in that last two years.", "In the wake of the global economic crisis, it was Chinese consumers that helped keep many major Swiss watchmakers afloat. As the\u00a0New York Times wrote last year, the increasing importance of the China market for these Swiss brands is clearly visible in the limited-edition lines and China-focused designs they\u2019re creating to tap the country\u2019s spending power. But these trends cut both ways; as the New York Times suggested, the return of classic, ultrathin designs is as much of a reaction to leaner economic times as it is to the tastes of mainland Chinese consumers.", "It\u2019s been well-established that China is very much in love with the luxury watch.

As\u00a0Hublot CEO Jean-Claude Biver (recently interviewed by Jing Daily at the Prestige Brands Forum) told Chinese Business, it\u2019s no accident that retro designs are now so prevalent, as Swiss watchmakers created these lines in an overt attempt to target Chinese consumers. As wealthy Chinese still prefer more conservative designs, in comparison to their Western counterparts, major watchmakers have been pushing simpler designs with large dials.", "In a recent interview, Christopher Babin, CEO of TAG Heuer recently echoed Biver\u2019s observations, noting that Chinese consumers prefer simple and elegant watches, and in fact, TAG\u2019s best selling collection in China is its more retro Carrera series.", "Gaudy to some, gorgeous to others", "Love II: Diamonds and Gold", "However, simplicity and elegance aren\u2019t enough for many Chinese consumers. Many want a bit more flash, and watchmakers have been quick to respond. As Omega Greater China president Lu Keqin said in a recent interview, early on in Omega\u2019s China operations, only a few models were diamond-studded, but the company has added a number of new diamond models in response to their immense popularity in China. According to a Cartier company spokesman, Cartier\u2019s three best-selling watch series in China all feature rose gold and diamond options.", "Apparently, to really shine in the Chinese watch market, your watches have to sparkle, in a way that may be considered overkill in more mature watch markets like Europe or the United States.", "One byproduct of China\u2019s increasingly attractive (yet increasingly crowded) luxury watch market is the entrance of brands not traditionally known for their watchmaking pedigree. Due to consumer obsession in China with Western fashion brands, the watch segments of luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Prada and Dior face fewer hurdles in China than they might in other markets. While serious watch aficionados may turn up their noses at a Louis Vuitton timepiece and opt for a comparably priced model by a brand that actually specializes in timepieces, the LV name is enough to convince many Chinese consumers.", "Naturally, like everything in the China luxury market, tastes will change and brands will adapt. Right now, though, with China still in an early \u2014 yet incredibly free-spending \u2014 stage, retro/classic styling, a good selection of models outfitted in gold and diamonds, and crossover appeal are three important draws.

Selling in Asia is easier for us of course, because it\u2019s closer and the culture is similar. We talk to our design team and tell them that if we want to be internationalised we need to do something very simple, sexy, the look has to fit Western tastes. Western people still like Western design.", "BoF: What about the Chinese customer? When they come to Shiatzy Chen, what are they looking for?", "HW: In Taiwan and China, they buy mostly the embroidered pieces. They feel, in terms of the craftsmanship and design, that Shiatzy Chen is very good; probably one of the best, and definitely comparable to the Western brands. They feel proud to wear our designs because we produce a very limited number of the same item. For instance, the jacket you just saw, we produced roughly one hundred pieces across four sizes. We manufacture about 70,000 pieces a year in total across 100 styles.", "So, you see, we produce a lot of different styles, but in a very limited quantity.", "\u2026", "BoF: Do you think the major international luxury brands are making money in China?", "HW: I think the big players like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Gucci are making very good money. Smaller brands like Celine and Chloe, maybe Jimmy Choo, still lose money in China. The more mass market Chinese brands which are inspired by bigger brands also make lots of money. For example Ports 1961 makes money.

They did a Chinese collection which, at least in my opinion, probably doesn\u2019t sell at all. It\u2019s very different from the \u2018Chinese\u2019 that we are looking for in Asia.

Gucci remained the only holdout, choosing instead to leave the Guangzhou market entirely for reasons unknown. Maybe Gucci\u2019s strategy of leaving Guangzhou and coming back in a low-key fashion seven years later is a form of very slow marketing. Of course, Guangzhou shoppers are already very familiar with Gucci, so maybe we don\u2019t need a lot of pomp and circumstance \u2014 we\u2019ll make our way to the new Gucci store on our own.", "Still, many are disappointed in Gucci\u2019s quiet return to Guangzhou, thinking that the brand missed an excellent promotional opportunity.

Is the low-key launch (or re-launch, in the case of Gucci in Guangzhou) better for top-tier cities, or is it simply too risky?

Both Ritson and Hublot\u2019s Jean-Claude Biver replied that everyone in the luxury industry is watching Herm\u00e8s very closely, as their experiment with Shang Xia will become a valuable case study. Ritson went on to say that localization and nationalism may not be as strong a factor as companies may think, as a fascination and\u00a0exoticism\u00a0with the Western world is equally strong.

Hennessy\u2019s DNA is about respecting different cultures, different people, and Hennessy is different in different countries. In America, we see [that a] very good-looking African-American man drinks Hennessy. In France, we see very distinguished Frenchmen drinking Hennessy and in Shanghai, we would see very funky, cool people drinking Hennessy. And in each place, the brand plays a different game because its DNA is flexible.

The Chinese customer is coming to luxury new, so they still like [an] extravagant image, a big statement, whereas in Europe it\u2019s quiet right now because of the recession.

However, in Asia the New York-based lifestyle brand is typically considered a mid-level brand. This is particularly in China, even though the brand is, in many ways, just now reaching that market. According to local Chinese media, due to less-than-successful brand management over the past few years, Ralph Lauren has missed an opportunity to position itself firmly as a luxury brand among Chinese consumers. Chinese-language news sources have additionally called attention to the company\u2019s notoriously sharp public conflicts with local brand agents.", "As Jing Daily previously pointed out,", "Usually, in the early days, foreign luxury brands owners would completely cede a given market to an agent when first entering the Chinese market.

The main reasons are probably due to irreconcilable conflicts between the brand and its agents.

However, each of these product lines has simply been mixed together by Ralph Lauren\u2019s local brand agents, with pricing being chaotic and irrational. As more low-end items were sold with other higher-end lines, Chinese consumers became confused, a development that has further damaged Ralph Lauren\u2019s brand image.

The reason I actually started doing it is because it\u2019s local, and also for me, there\u2019s really not that many factories that do these things by hand. Most of the glasses and eyewear nowadays is all injection-molded and mass-produced and manufactured outside Europe.

So you do see a trend, especially when I went to Shanghai, of consumers slowly moving away from just big brands and designer brands and taking an interest in smaller designers, independent designers, and new designers as well. That will be quite an interesting trend to watch, so Shanghai will definitely be my first approach in mainland China.", "It\u2019s interesting to see people [in China] spending money on things that actually have been hand-made rather than just going to Louis Vuitton or Chanel.

It\u2019s people who really want to spend money on design, the actual quality of the glasses, and the concept behind the brand. So yeah, I\u2019m not really too worried, but you know, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll really have to think about in the future, I guess.", "JD: You said you\u2019ve got your sights set on Beijing and Shanghai, but what about other markets like Hong Kong?

I think style and fashion-wise, they\u2019re a little ahead of mainland China. But you know, Shanghai and Beijing, big cities in mainland China, are catching up very quickly.

You\u2019ve said that you\u2019re looking for a more sophisticated consumer who wants to buy new designers, but how else do you plan on competing with these big companies in China? Is it word of mouth again? Or do you have some other plans?", "FW: I\u2019m actually not really thinking about competing with them. I think the market they\u2019re targeting and the sort of consumer I\u2019m targeting is slightly different. I can\u2019t compete with the bigger companies with big financial backing and proper adverts and advertising campaigns. For me, my brand is an independent, small brand, and it\u2019s mainly eyewear, and the quality of the glasses and how they\u2019re made are different. For me, it\u2019s more of a personal relationship that I have, this method of individual customers, buyers, or boutiques.

In terms of age or profession? How do you break down your target consumer?", "FW: In Japan, [my customers] are mostly in their early 20s up to their 40s or 50s. It really depends. Some of the designs I have are quite timeless, classic and sophisticated. There are other designs that I carry that are slightly quirky and bit mad, so attractive to a younger generation and people who like quirky and interesting designs and don\u2019t mind actually going on the street wearing mad designs. It\u2019s slightly different, my designs are quite wide-ranging. In Japan, it sells to a quite younger generation to 40s and 50s. In China, I\u2019m anticipating it will be the same, sort of, the young and stylish generation.", "But eyewear is interesting because it\u2019s not like clothing or shoes.

One of them is called the \u201cHollywood\u201d \u2014 maybe the name is attractive. The other one is \u201cPeony.\u201d Those two shades are my most popular designs.", "JD: And those are kind of classic designs?", "FW: Yes, quite classic, with round edges. I guess it\u2019s a bit soft, quite feline shaped and soft. Some girls don\u2019t really like square frames, or really round frames, so those are the two frames that are kind of in-between. Very classic.", "JD: It seems that the Word-of-Mouth marketing plan you\u2019ve got has worked very well for some companies in China.", "FW: Yeah, especially with the Internet and social networks. I think it\u2019s very powerful. I would say that people trust their friends and people that they know when they suggest, \u201cYou should go on this site, you should see her glasses.\u201d You trust them, instead of people always being worried when they see television adverts and [the product] looks too good to be true. So for me, word of mouth is has been very good, and it\u2019s actually a really good marketing strategy for smaller brands.", "JD: We\u2019re really fascinated with your company because we\u2019ve been closely watching the increasing sophistication of consumers in the biggest cities in China, how many of them are not just plastering themselves in logos anymore.", "FW: Absolutely, and in China it\u2019s such a huge population.

With the ensuing increase in the number of wealthy residents, major luxury brands have begun to stream in, and the city now boasts two Louis Vuitton boutiques, a Gucci store, and brands like Tiffany & Co., Bally and Zegna concentrated at the high-end Charter Shopping Center (\u5353\u5c55\u8d2d\u7269\u4e2d\u5fc3). But interestingly enough, one factor that sets Shenyang apart from other fast-growing second-tier cities is its increasingly sophisticated second-hand luxury market. With Shenyang surpassing Hangzhou last year to become the third largest single luxury market in China with sales\u00a0totaling\u00a01.5 billion yuan (US$229 million), putting it behind only Beijing and Shanghai, a flood of high-end goods have washed over the city.

The event ultimately pulled in 240,000 yuan (US$37,000). Explained manager Mr. Liu, Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market has a great deal of potential. One month earlier, a similar event made more than 100,000 yuan, but this comparatively large event was not only a financial success but also proved extremely popular among Shenyang shoppers.", "Last December, after noting the potential for the future development of Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market, manager Liu decided to start a consignment business.

Far and away, the most popular items are women\u2019s handbags. The consumer base is predominantly female, with Liu saying that female shoppers comprise more than 70 percent of shoppers at his store. Most of Liu\u2019s customers are independent business owners, housewives, or white collar workers between the ages of 30-40. As most of these individuals socialize with a similarly high-income, luxury-obsessed crowd, Liu sees no shortage of potential demand for second-hand goods.", "The Sina article goes on to note that the rapid development of Shenyang\u2019s second-hand luxury market may boil down to the fact that some of the top luxury brands and most popular handbags are extremely hard to come by in Shenyang, with people there often having to sign up on long\u00a0wait-lists\u00a0for Hermes bags in other cities. Currently, there are more than 20 high-end consignment shops in Shenyang, most of which are centered in the city\u2019s Huanggu (\u7687\u59d1), Xitie (\u94c1\u897f) and\u00a0Hunnan (\u6d51\u5357) neighborhoods, or near the Charter Shopping Center.

While I see the clothing as simply exquisite and top of the line in wool textile technology, there\u2019s a strange feeling, because I think in the assembly of various Indian elements, the inspiration becomes scattered, suspended in the air but not solidified.

Of course, there are some consumers who are highly educated and erudite, some rich second- and third-generation individuals, and those who have had experience living abroad \u2014 all of whom have learned how to enjoy luxury goods. They pursue a higher quality of life and look to reflect their personal tastes through luxury consumption.", "But since the early days of China\u2019s \u201creform and opening up,\u201d a large number of nouveau riche and bigwigs were born.

(Rare in those days.) Soon, these people began to buy luxury cars and mansions, traveling overseas to buy luxury goods, and eventually taking part in tour groups focused solely on buying luxury goods in Europe, sweeping through stores and leaving people dumbstruck. A good example [of conspicuous consumption in China] is how Louis Vuitton has recently sought to cultivate a more low-key image with its latest collections, yet at stores in mainland China the company must continue to stock old models that prominently display the LV logo, or else they know they won\u2019t sell any bags.", "In China, many people live frugally for months to buy an LV key chain, a pair of Chanel sunglasses or a Prada wallet. I heard a joke once about a girl sitting on a bus was carrying an LV bag that was ripped apart by a robber, who was looking to steal the mobile phone and 1,000 yuan she was carrying. As the man ran away, leaving the girl with a destroyed LV bag, she screamed, \u201cIf you wanted the money you should\u2019ve just said something. Why\u2019d you have to destroy my bag?\u201d.

For them, the purchase of a luxury item is a way to stick a label on themselves, draw them into a certain social circle, and bring them opportunities. Another use of luxury purchases for this group is to give away as a high-end gift, since it\u2019s tacky to just give someone money. For example, LOTOS glasses [from Germany] are a hot commodity in China, and a considerable number of sales come from people who give pairs as gifts to government officials who have a yen for low-key luxury.", "From my point of view, luxury is innocent, and it has its uses.

But the form, content and scale of the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter fashion weeks greatly differ, and they have no fixed location. Why is that?", "YQZ: There is actually a historical reason. Shanghai Fashion Week being held twice a year is a recent development. In 2003, Shanghai Fashion Week began to be held as a separate event in the latter half of the year, while the Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival was held in the first half. The Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival has been held for nearly twenty years, so you can imagine that in the 90s, it was a popular fashion event, and it also included a fashion forum, a design competition and other related activities.", "Therefore, in the last few years, the Shanghai Fashion Week held in the first part of the year was usually at a newly built Creative Park in collaboration with the Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival, while the second Shanghai Fashion Week was held in basic fixed tents at Fuxing Park.", "This time, with Mode Shanghai and Shanghai Fashion Week held at the same time, most important is that the sponsored activities are well organized.

In subsequent years, Shanghai Fashion Week also had shows from brands like Nina Ricci, Karl Lagerfeld and Jean Paul Gaultier, among others.

Therefore, with the absence of big labels in recent years, Shanghai Fashion Week\u2019s overall appeal was affected.", "While this is somewhat further down the road, major cities around the world essentially have their own fashion weeks, but most of them consist of local activities.

You cannot surpass Paris, and Milan has the big brands. The brands who participate in these two fashion weeks are very important, to the extent that the menswear and womenswear are organized a month apart. While London brings together cutting-edge avant-garde designers, London Fashion Week has the smallest influence of the four. One common feature of Paris, Milan and London are that the shows are export-oriented to allow retailers from all over the world to place orders.

For example, U.S. Vogue\u2019s Editor in Chief, Anna Wintour, missed part of Milan Fashion Week due to the Oscars, and whatever brand scheduled their show for that day certainly missed having here there.", "Right now, the timing of the four major fashion weeks is the result of a back-and-forth. London Fashion Week received pressure from New York and Milan, putting its time ahead of New York Fashion Week, but the arrangement is actually inconvenient, to have to go to the UK and then New York before returning to Europe, and this may cause people to give up going to London Fashion Week. So, ultimately, there\u2019s no gain.", "The current timing is New York, London, Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks running for a month between February 9 to March 9, and other fashion weeks can only be arranged before or after, such as Berlin, Copenhagen and Stockholm, who arranged to run from the end of January to early February, in which Copenhagen and Stockholm was placed in the beginning and end to facilitate those who wanted to participate in both.", "BP: You wrote an article comparing Shanghai and Beijing\u2019s Fashion Weeks, the former described as \u201cbringing in,\u201d and the latter \u201cpushing out.\u201d In the long run, which city\u2019s influence will be greater?

The Tivoli PM rose from $1,000 USD (6,572 RMB) to $1,130 USD (7,426 RMB) in the United States and from 690 euros (6,280 RMB) to 780 euros (7,099 RMB) in Italy, both increasing by 13%. ", "Louis Vuitton\u2019s price increases mainly pertained to the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, among other countries. The highest gain within the United States was the Mahina leather series, which rose from $2,800 USD (18,401 RMB) to $3,550 USD (23,330 RMB), an increase of nearly 30%.", "Employees from Louis Vuitton\u2019s Greater China customer service hotline said that they have yet to receive any notices about domestic price increases. The Neverfull PM is currently still 5,350 yuan (US$814) and the Tivoli PM is still 8,550 yuan ($1,301). The price difference between buying abroad and domestically has significantly lessened. With the exchange rates now 6.6 yuan against the US dollar and 8.9 yuan against the euro, buying from the U.S. is only 532 yuan cheaper for the Neverfull PM and 1,092 yuan cheaper for the Tivoli PM, already bucking the previous mentality that \u201cpurchasing abroad can be 20-30 percent cheaper.\u201d", "Louis Vuitton\u2019s Tivoli PM, which is now only 1,092 RMB ($166 USD) cheaper in the US and 1,451 RMB (158 euros) in Italy.", "The luxury industry seems to believe that pricing is a strategy in itself to push market demand, not only as a simple assurance of value but also to assure a high-end and exclusive image. For example, the price of a Chanel Classic Flap bag has doubled since 2006 and is now being sold for $3,200 USD (21,030 RMB), which is a key factor in its maintenance of an ultra-luxury status. Torsten Stocker, of the Monitor Group, a global strategy consulting firm with offices in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, told Jing Daily that many factors may be at work behind this strategy. It could simply be \u201cmarket forces at work\u201d to balance the dependence that many brands\u00a0currently\u00a0have on the Chinese market, a reaction to price increases of raw materials, or an aid to help cut back on gray-market business.", "Beijing-based model and founder of 360Fashion.net Anina Trepte\u00a0told Jing Daily that, from her observations, many consumers are still seeking purchases abroad due to import taxes. As the Chinese government has imposed more stringent customs inspections, Anina has noted that her friends \u201cnow bring back fewer goods from Europe, as the customs fines are high in airports.\u201d Additionally, as Jing Daily reported this week, Wang Jianlin (\u738b\u5efa\u6797), the high-profile chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group, has stepped up to oppose China\u2019s high luxury tax, stating that the luxury tax is the single biggest obstacle to the development of a more international shopping culture in China.", "With these factors gradually coming together to act as a deterrent for Chinese consumers to shop for luxury overseas, buying domestically may soon become more appealing.

This isn\u2019t terribly surprising, considering consumer sophistication in top-tier cities is apparently outpacing brand outreach, and as more newly wealthy consumers load up on brands like LV and Gucci, \u201cearly adopters\u201d are likely to move on to less \u201cmass market\u201d luxury brands.

Other trends, including the key position that \u201cgifting\u201d plays in the China luxury market, consumer demand for better service, and the importance of second- and third-tier cities have been covered well by Jing Daily and other China-focused outlets regularly over the past 11 months.", "As Bain notes, the increase in domestic spending (as opposed to shopping in Hong Kong or overseas) has been a key trend this year. Although domestic shopping still makes up less than 50% of luxury spending among Chinese consumers (44%, to be exact), the study notes that this is changing as more brands have focused on providing latest collections in the mainland market, including lower-ticket items in mainland inventories, and reducing operating margins to offset the tax difference. Going on, Bain identifies five main reasons Chinese shoppers will choose to shop locally rather than overseas: a desire to be perceived as a \u201cVIP,\u201d a better shopping experience, better size availability, access to service after sales, and impulse. As expected, the two main reasons Chinese shoppers will purchase luxury items overseas remain lower prices and a broader product selection.", "Another interesting finding is the growing importance of the Internet as an information source. Bain found that 60% of potential shoppers get their information about luxury goods online \u2014 up from only around 25% in 2006 \u2014 which makes the Internet the second most popular source of information after magazines (72%). We\u2019ve seen a much more focused effort by several digitally savvy brands to invest in online outreach in China, although some have been far more successful than others.", "The third interesting trend, one that we\u2019ve watched closely this year, is that of localization at the city level.

However, other recent surveys have indicated that high-end online shopping is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce segments, with more Taobao stores specializing in luxury products (generally purchased and sold by Chinese students in Europe or North America) to help netizens sidestep China\u2019s steep luxury tax.", "While the growing popularity of high-end online shopping, particularly in wealthier cities like Shanghai, presents serious challenges for high-end companies, it also presents great opportunities. A handful of companies, such as Giorgio Armani and Dunhill, have already made moves to capitalize on this shift from low- to high-end online shopping, launching Chinese-language e-commerce sites, and others \u2014 such as Hermes and Tiffany \u2014 have launched full simplified-Chinese-version sites, although they (and other major brands like Chanel) are resisting the urge to launch online stores at the moment.", "Tweet ", "// \ndocument.write('<iframe  frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?url=%url%&#038;appkey=&#038;type=6\" mce_src=\"http://hits.sinajs.cn/A1/weiboshare.html?url=%url%&amp;appkey=&amp;type=6\" width=\"86\" height=\"16\"></iframe>'.replace(/%url%/,encodeURIComponent(location.href)));\n// ]]&gt;"]}, {"title": "Shanghai VIVE Brings Back 1930s Glamour; But Will Chinese Consumers Bite?", "meta": "August 24, 2010", "paragraphs": ["Old Shanghai: Selling point or Achilles Heel?", "This week, the long-awaited launch of Shanghai VIVE (\u53cc\u59b9), the new high-end line by the Chinese cosmetics\u00a0manufacturer\u00a0Shanghai Jahwa, took place at the newly restored Shanghai Peace Hotel.

Although Shanghai Jahwa\u2019s lower-priced imprints, the mid-priced Herborist (which recorded 60% growth last year) and budget-friendly Liushen, have succeeded by largely avoiding direct competition with imported brands, Shanghai VIVE will have to convince consumers that its retro style and cool packaging is backed up with an import-quality product.", "As China Economic Net pointed out this week, Shanghai VIVE\u2019s initial product line includes \u201ccosmetics, jewelry and accessories, with prices ranging from 300 yuan (US$44) to more than 1500 yuan ($221), a significant price hike in comparison to [Herborist or Liushen].\u201d According to China Daily, a 50-milliliter bottle of VIVE perfume will cost around 1,000 yuan ($147) \u2014 pretty pricey when you consider most imported perfumes cost anywhere from 500-900 yuan.", "This places Shanghai VIVE in the same price range as Chanel, Dior and other dominant luxury brands in the perfume segment. A gutsy move, especially considering that it\u2019s far from certain that Chinese consumers will be willing to pay a premium for a local brand, no matter how well it\u2019s packaged and marketed. An article today in the Chinese portal Nanxun predicts a cool reaction from brand-worshipping Chinese consumers towards Shanghai VIVE.

From the article (translation by Jing Daily team):", "[Shanghai VIVE] won\u2019t be able to conquer most markets in China. Furthermore, Non-Shanghainese don\u2019t have any real connection to Shanghai culture. The cultures of north China and Shanghai are like oil and water \u2014 quite simply, like the local TV shows only watched and understood by locals, Shanghai culture is\u00a0inscrutable for outsiders.

As Gu said recently, it\u2019s likely going to take quite a while for the brand to build a following, since \u201cits advantage [over imported brands], so far as we hear, is its brand culture, not anything special in cosmetology. What women in their mid-30s care most about is the beauty features of a product instead of its brand story.\u201d", "However, Shanghai Jahwa representatives have said that they expect the new brand to be profitable within seven years. Considering the profits Shanghai Jahwa is currently seeing with its other brands, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll bankroll the new venture as long as it takes to capture some coveted market share from foreign rivals.", "As always, we\u2019ll have to take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach with Shanghai VIVE.

Although perfume and cologne are not as widely worn on a regular basis in China as they are in Western markets, Ms. Pilkinton has noticed a growing number of Chinese shoppers gradually replacing the Russian, Middle Eastern and American shoppers who make up much of Ormonde Jayne\u2019s present customer base. Discussing these and other trends in the London high-end retail market, Ms. Pilkington shared with us some of her observations \u2014 both personal and professional \u2014 on how Chinese shoppers are shaping, and will continue to shape, the global luxury market.", "Linda Pilkington, who opened the first Ormonde Jayne boutique on Bond Street in 2002, is no stranger to China, having traveled to the mainland and Hong Kong a number of times over the years to source native fragrances. Ormonde Jayne\u2019s \u201cOsmanthus\u201d line, modeled after the osmanthus shrubs that are commonly seen (and smelled) in parks throughout China, is one of the company\u2019s most popular fragrances, particularly among visiting Chinese tourists. Telling us about the reaction that Chinese shoppers \u2014 many of whom are traveling with tour groups from mainland China \u2014 have to her company\u2019s fragrances, Pilkington said that introducing her products to Chinese tourists, who rarely speak English, is a far \u201cpurer experience,\u201d as they\u2019re less swayed by marketing-speak and are simply choosing products based on personal, sensual preferences.", "This, Ms. Pilkington observed, is a very important development, since Chinese luxury shoppers typically seek out the items that are most ostentatious and heavily branded \u2014 Louis Vuitton bags, Chanel sunglasses, etc. \u2014 and luxury fragrances, as an \u201cinvisible status symbol,\u201d are a comparatively new concept for them.", "Discussing the differences between shoppers from mainland China and Hong Kong, Pilkington noted that it\u2019s not always easy to tell where a given customer comes from, but Hong Kong-based shoppers tend to speak English at a fairly high level and dress in a more \u201cEuropean\u201d style, while mainland Chinese often shop in groups and \u2014 as mentioned earlier \u2014 often do not speak English. Additionally, many Hong Kong residents \u2014 who mostly grew up during colonial British rule \u2014 already have the habit of wearing perfume or cologne while this generation of Chinese shoppers is really the first to give it a try.", "As for visible trends in the demographics of shoppers on the high street in London, Pilkington said there has been a noticeable shift in the last 18 months from Russian and Middle Eastern shoppers to Asian \u2014 particularly Chinese \u2014 shoppers. When asked if the growing numbers of Chinese shoppers in Ormonde\u2019s Bond St. boutique, or at Ormonde Jayne\u2019s counter at Harrod\u2019s, has had an effect on the products she\u2019s introducing, Linda Pilkington said she is putting less focus on introducing new fragrances and more on products that highlight British craftsmanship and quality, such as cosmetic puffs, yet this is not solely the result of greater Chinese interest.", "Lighter scents like Osmanthus are popular with Chinese tourists", "Jing Daily then asked Ms. Pilkington about her future plans, and whether she expects to take Ormonde Jayne to the China market. In terms of immediate plans, Pilkington said she plans to open six new points of sale in London in the next two years, and is then considering international locations in Russia and the Middle East by 2011-2012. She also plans to expand into the U.S. market by 2012.", "In terms of the China market, Pilkinton is considering moving first into department stores or opening a specialized boutique in Hong Kong as a first step into China, but is weighing options on expanding into mainland China \u2014 with Shanghai as the most likely candidate \u2014 in the short- to medium-term.", "While courting Chinese consumers in the luxury fragrance market is difficult, as companies need to overcome both the present logo-worship of Chinese customers while investing time in customer education, Linda Pilkinton\u2019s observations about mainland Chinese customers \u2014 who often wander into her Bond St. boutique while on tour groups, choose fragrances based on personal preference rather than being swayed by sales staff or marketing materials, and are drawn to the British craftsmanship and packaging of her products \u2014 are valuable indicators of a broader trend we\u2019ve kept an eye on in the Chinese luxury market: that of many Chinese luxury consumers becoming sophisticated to the point of looking beyond popular logos to find what they really like on a personal level.", "The Jing Daily team would like to thank Linda Pilkington for taking the time to speak to us.

So then, as independent artists, should we refuse to serve as a high-end marketing tool for luxury brands? Personally, I feel the answer is, \u201cnot necessarily.\u201d Art needs independent creation, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily need \u201cindependent display.\u201d Why can\u2019t we use their popularity to promote art?

Every time I go to Europe to take part in an exhibition, I always see long lines wrapping around the museum. When art appreciation becomes a habit, a way of life, naturally a society\u2019s art industry will develop. To think of it now, perhaps luxury brands have a role to play in helping the general public develop this sort of lifestyle. It\u2019s worth mentioning that over the past 15 years, high-end European luxury brands have continuously worked with artists, lending their name to all types of arts events and exhibitions.", "What\u2019s more, there are examples like the Cartier Foundation or Prada Foundation in Milan that have established their own art museums, dedicated to promoting the arts. Even after the financial crisis hit, and the American government suspended support of many art museums, these luxury brands maintained their support for their art programs.", "When luxury brands spare no effort to emphasize that \u201cour products are also works of art,\u201d getting help from their art initiatives, they\u2019re actually also doing another thing \u2014 they\u2019re exposing the general public to true works of art, letting people know what art is. Even famous arts venues like the Shanghai Art Museum that host large-scale events have trouble attracting more than 5,000 visitors a day.

If the world\u2019s leading luxury brands can bring art to these consumers, art will naturally reach a greater audience.

Looking to take advantage of this trend, in the last year many luxury brands have redoubled their China efforts, opening flashy new flagship stores, branching out into second- or third-tier cities, creating China-only limited edition collections, launching Chinese-language websites, and staging elaborate events not only to cash in on Chinese \u201cshopoholism,\u201d but to make clear their commitment to the China market and try to build stronger brand loyalty.", "This weekend, the Wall Street Journal caught up with Helmuth Hennig in Hong Kong to discuss the opportunities \u2014 and challenges \u2014 presented by the fast-growing China luxury market. From the interview:", "WSJ: What\u2019s the biggest challenge in China for you right now?", "Mr. Hennig: One of the biggest issues is this irrational exuberance. China has suddenly become the fix-all for everything. At the end of the day we tell our suppliers nothing goes upward forever, there are always bumps in the road. China is still wary about opening up the floodgates. They have their own rules that you might even call non-tariff barriers where they limit market access. Also, it is changing from being a city-based market to much more a regional market based around greater Beijing, greater Shanghai, the West, the middle part of China around Wuhan and Chongqing. All that needs to be dealt with from a distribution, sales and marketing perspective.", "WSJ: Why did Jebsen make the shift from distributor of industrial products to luxury brands?", "Mr. Hennig: We\u2019re a privately held company and don\u2019t have access to financial markets so we need to build on our own capabilities. Ten years ago we started with Porsche in China. There was nobody who wanted to touch Porsche at that time but we had been doing Porsche in Hong Kong for 45 years. I think we were overtaken by events at the end of the day as China\u2019s car market exploded. I\u2019m not saying it will happen the same way in every other business.", "WSJ: Is it possible to know which brands will work?", "Mr. Hennig: That would be a recipe you\u2019d keep to yourself. It\u2019s more about as a brand whether you are committed to China. You have to be willing to accept the rules they play by and to sustain your initial impact. If you look at the brands that have been there a long time, the ones that have sustained it over 10 or 20 years are the most successful today. If you enter now it\u2019s very cluttered.", "Despite being cluttered, brands looking to differentiate and grow in the China market would be well served by paying attention to the \u201cfive critical areas\u201d that must be addressed for success, as outlined by Bruno Lannes and Xuan Wang earlier this year:", "1. ) Build brand awareness by investing to educate consumers about product quality and brand heritage. Emphasize unique traits to differentiate the brand in a crowded field. Weaker brands won\u2019t be able to compete with a well-orchestrated campaign. In Bain\u2019s 2006 study of \u201cmost desirable brands\u201d, Rolex was ranked No. 10. In the 2009 survey, Rolex moved up to No 4. This improved ranking is directly related to its brand building efforts.", "2.) Develop a strong retail talent pipeline, with processes in place for attracting and retaining employees, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there\u2019s a severe talent shortage. For example, leading brands offer international rotation programs to their store managers. Sales employees have the opportunity to enjoy a true luxury experience during special training sessions. LV even developed a specific training program for new Chinese graduates that introduces them to retail operation management.", "3.) Use customer relationship management tools to personalize customer relationships and add value to services. Outstanding service encourages customers to do more of their luxury shopping domestically. One way to win customer loyalty is to provide better service when they shop abroad by beefing up the number of Chinese-speaking salespersons. Several brands are developing a global database for VIP customers by collecting personal data, including the customer\u2019s name, nationality and purchase history. The database allows brands to recognize their VIP customers wherever they shop and give them top-notch service.", "4.) Invest in the Internet as a powerful communications channel. Use third-party platforms with caution. In the seven categories we studied, 70 percent of the top 5 brands have simplified Chinese websites offering product information and brand news. Some brands such as Lanc\u00f4me go one step further. Lanc\u00f4me pioneered an online beauty community, \u201cLanc\u00f4me Rose Beauty,\u201d with over four million subscribers\u2026", "5.) Localize products and marketing for Chinese consumers, while striking the right balance to maintain the value of the brand.

While the luxury tax encourages less confident shoppers to consider buying domestic brands, and brings in a considerable amount for the government in tax receipts, China\u2019s luxury tax has also led a significant percentage of luxury buyers to do their shopping abroad or in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong or Macau. According to Bain & Company\u2019s recent \u201cChina Luxury Market Study,\u201d in 2008 spending on luxury goods within mainland China made up only about 40% of the total for the country, with the other 60% spent overseas (including Hong Kong and Macau).", "Interestingly enough, the Chinese government likely cares less about domestic shoppers buying from foreign companies overseas than these companies themselves do. Over the past 20 years, as more international brands have entered the mainland market and more \u2014 and more elaborate \u2014 malls and shopping venues have been built throughout the country, buyers have continued to shop outside the mainland or, in more recent years, online rather than in mainland boutiques. As a result, many of the gleaming, modern boutiques that brands like Chanel, Bottega Veneta and Coach have opened in the last year function simply as glorified showrooms, where potential buyers window-shop before purchasing items online or on a cross-border shopping jaunt.", "So what can luxury brands do to get more Chinese luxury buyers to shop at home? This week, Forbes China looks at some possibilities, noting what Jing Daily has said before \u2014 that luxury brands should stop trying to convince themselves that wealthy shoppers in Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou will suddenly start shopping at home when they can easily do so overseas, and these brands should look to emerging second- and third-tier cities for future growth. From the article:", "Mainland retailers are hard-pressed to compete with foreign merchants who offer significantly discounted prices and broader product selection. For example, the discounted price of one luxury brand during seasonal sales in Hong Kong is about 60 percent of the regular price in mainland outlets.", "The most dramatic opportunity for new growth in China is not in Shanghai, Beijing and China\u2019s other largest cities.

But to realize the growth potential, luxury brand makers must surmount three major hurdles: a scarcity of high-end retail space, the lack of well-trained luxury sales staff, and local malls that understand the unique needs and standards of luxury brands.", "The article goes on to identify five key areas that luxury brands must address now in order to ensure sustainable profitability in the mainland:", "1. ) Build brand awareness by investing to educate consumers about product quality and brand heritage. Emphasize unique traits to differentiate the brand in a crowded field. Weaker brands won\u2019t be able to compete with a well-orchestrated campaign. In Bain\u2019s 2006 study of \u201cmost desirable brands\u201d, Rolex was ranked No. 10. In the 2009 survey, Rolex moved up to No 4. This improved ranking is directly related to its brand building efforts.", " 2.) Develop a strong retail talent pipeline, with processes in place for attracting and retaining employees, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there\u2019s a severe talent shortage. For example, leading brands offer international rotation programs to their store managers. Sales employees have the opportunity to enjoy a true luxury experience during special training sessions. LV even developed a specific training program for new Chinese graduates that introduces them to retail operation management.", " 3.) Use customer relationship management tools to personalize customer relationships and add value to services. Outstanding service encourages customers to do more of their luxury shopping domestically. One way to win customer loyalty is to provide better service when they shop abroad by beefing up the number of Chinese-speaking salespersons. Several brands are developing a global database for VIP customers by collecting personal data, including the customer\u2019s name, nationality and purchase history. The database allows brands to recognize their VIP customers wherever they shop and give them top-notch service.", " 4.) Invest in the Internet as a powerful communications channel. Use third-party platforms with caution. In the seven categories we studied, 70 percent of the top 5 brands have simplified Chinese websites offering product information and brand news. Some brands such as Lanc\u00f4me go one step further. Lanc\u00f4me pioneered an online beauty community, \u201cLanc\u00f4me Rose Beauty,\u201d with over four million subscribers\u2026", " 5.) Localize products and marketing for Chinese consumers, while striking the right balance to maintain the value of the brand. Asia localization has already happened for example through the introduction of a wide range of skincare whitening products, specialized sizing and fit for clothing, and products emblazoned with brand logos for entry-level consumers..In addition,\u00a0 several brands have allowed local teams to select what they want to offer in Chinese stores.\u00a0 Last, brands reach out to Chinese shoppers by using Chinese celebrities in their marketing campaigns\u2013 Ziyi Zhang for Omega, Bingbing Li for Gucci and Qi Shu for Hugo Boss.", "While many of the suggestions made by Bain & Company tread the same ground as previous articles on this subject \u2014 particularly this one by China luxury expert Patricia Pao \u2014 it is extremely valuable because it looks more at the technological aspects of luxury retailing than the marketing aspects.

For many years, I have been the first one in China to have built not only a luxury brand but also a guideline or a theory in the field as well as to have put it into practice. Meanwhile, I have been sharing my experience with my counterparts in the industry. As a Chinese proverb says, \u201cIt takes a decade to sharpen a sword\u201d.", "In each of these passing decades, we have walked, along with our nation, a path from self-awakening to self-sufficiency, and from independence to prosperity. Accompanied by the peaceful emergence of the Chinese nation, we are now embracing with confidence a new era of renaissance and revitalization in Chinese luxury civilization: that is the revitalization of the ancient Chinese luxury civilization and the development of Chinese luxury brands.", "Since the birth of NE.TIGER, we have pursued a course of dedicated study and research into the history and the culture of the luxury goods both in the East and the West. During the process, we found it is evident that the history of luxury goods in China dates back a very long time, and we might even say that China once conquered the world with its luxury products. I give you three examples: the first, in 139 B.C., the Silk Road established by ZHANG QIAN during the Han Dynasty extended into Persia, brought fine and exquisite Chinese silks as far as the Roman Empire, the center of Europe of the time, which was regarded as the lead of fashion. The second example is dated 1800 years ago. China in the TANG dynasty was not only the political, economic, and cultural center of the world, but also the center of fashion, as we can see today from how ladies were dressed in ancient frescoes and stone sculptures, indicating the splendid and open culture of fashion in the TANG Dynasty. We can even find many of its reflections and influence in evening gowns nowadays.", "My last example: in the MING Dynasty, the years between 1405 to 1433, ZHENG HE, sent by the Chinese government, voyaged 7 times to the West with hundreds of boats full of Chinese silk, Yun brocade, jade, China, tea and other renowned Chinese luxury products given as gifts to the world where they went. It was the peak time of the \u2018Silk Road of the Sea\u2019. That not only showed the grace of a Chinese nation of courtesy but also illustrated how China contributed to the culture and tradition of the appreciation and the consumption of luxury goods in the west.", "NE-TIGER's designs are imbued with Chinese design and cultural elements", "Unfortunately, the Chinese feudal system restricted the birth of luxury brands as opposed to luxury products, and as a result of the lost opportunity of the industrial revolution it was only very recently that China started the development of luxury goods through building brands and enterprises.", "As far as our challenge and difficulty is concerned, through the 30 years since the beginning of the reform in China, like the sea opening itself to the inflow of hundreds of rivers, many foreign luxury brands have entered into the Chinese market rapidly. To their great satisfaction, all those brands have not only encountered in China the best opportunities they have ever seen for one century or two \u2013 since their birth in their own home markets \u2013 but also they have been granted privileged status and super-super-national treatment by Chinese, which never happened to them elsewhere. They come here to invade cities and to occupy the land, to grab the market and to pan for gold in our prosperity.", "Meanwhile, some high-end shopping malls and department stores in major Chinese cities, for the sake of their own short-term interest, are willing to open the doors and to bow down themselves in front of foreign luxury brands by offering many privileges. For instance, foreign brands are always offered considerable discounts, the best locations, extended rent exemptions for a couple of years, covering cost for store renovation of the openings, reduced fees, etc. \u2013 all of these contribute to their rapid expansion in China. I cite here an example of a well-known western luxury brand. In a famous commercial avenue in Beijing, within 300 meters, it opened 3 stores in the past 2 years, at nearly zero cost.", "However in contrast, most new-born Chinese luxury brands are not treated fairly here and have to operate under considerable restrictions. Moreover, in the markets where there is only market reform and no market openings such as in the US and in Europe, we experience actual discrimination. In spite of all these facts, we take pride in the passion, loyalty, recognition and support of our customers. We believe that as our brands grow such difficulties will be just temporary, and with the cultivation of our brands, we can transform the challenges that we face into opportunities.", "Chinese luxury brands have global vision and our major advantage is that we have our roots in our 5000-year civilization. However, it\u2019s not enough. We should apply our innovation on it, in order to give it a new life.

How do you see this phenomenon?", "As time passed by, the expectation and demand of luxury goods consumers evolved. Nowadays, a noticeable LOGO on a luxury product is not enough to match with consumers\u2019 social identity and status. They are paying more attention to, not only outstanding manufacturing and excellent service, but also appealing philosophy, value, culture and lifestyle that a luxury brand implies. More and more brands have gone beyond their distinctive LOGOs or patterns, and started to seek fashionable, personalized and artistic design in their new products, in order to fulfill consumers\u2019 needs.
